Hi, I’m Jess. I build things that surprise and delight people, and I use data to make the world a better place. I want to work for a company that does those things too.

By trade I am a software developer. I build awesome webapps and have done a bit of data science work too. Along the way I’ve picked up enough related tech to handle the full stack: frontend, backend, devops, database administration, and even a touch of design and marketing.

My current weapon of choice is Python, but I believe in using the best tool for the job. If you are someone who enjoys long lists of keywords, here are a few that I’ve worked with most recently: Python, Django, RQ, JQuery, Git, Linux, Nginx, Uwsgi, Memcached, Redis, Varnish, Puppet, Vagrant, Postgres. In the past I’ve also worked in the Java, .NET, and PHP ecosystems, but I won’t swamp you with all of those keywords too.

I’ve built data-crunching SaaS tools for internet marketers, a hosting dashboard, open source Django apps, Stripe payment integration, WordPress plugins, and a bunch of odds and ends. You can see some of the highlights in my [portfolio](http://grokcode.com/programmer-portfolio/).

Also, I have a snazzy bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the University of California at Berkeley, and enjoy opportunities for continued education.

For the past few years I’ve been a solo bootstrapper working on [Author Alcove](http://authoralcove.com), a book discovery service for readers. I’ve hit a bunch of new user milestones, worked through [scaling issues](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/grokcode/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/nginx-log-analysis.ipynb), learned a lot, and had a great ride, but now I’m ready to move on to my next big thing.

That big thing is a full-time position with a company that moves quickly – a startup or established company that has lean / agile in it’s DNA. Broadly speaking, I am interested in alternative energy, quantified self, home automation, and developer tools. But there are intensely interesting problems in every industry, and if you are solving them, I would love to hear about it.

At the moment I’m in the D.C. area of the United States. Remote work is strongly preferred, but relocation could work, especially if the location is outside of major metro areas.

If you think we could build amazing things together, let’s chat: [jess@grokcode.com](mailto:jess@grokcode.com).
