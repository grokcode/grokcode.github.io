Hi, I&#8217;m Jess Johnson. I am a [developer](#developer), a [writer](#writer), and a [world citizen](#expat).

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/grokcode) for occasional side channel banter, on [Github](https://github.com/grokcode) for open source, and on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/104959372961388172986?rel=author) for completeness. You can also email me at <jess@grokcode.com>.

## Developer {#developer}

### A brief history

So the obligatory how I got started programming story: I taught myself BASIC using my fourth grade math textbook. My first nontrivial program was a text adventure game backed by a big spaghetti mess of GOTOs. I&#8217;ve been hooked ever since.

I was ambitious enough to set my sights on a Computer Science degree from one of the top 5 Universities in the US. After applying to the University of California Berkeley three times, they finally let me in, due to what I&#8217;m guessing was some combination of persistence, luck, skill, and a desire not to be bothered anymore. I learned a tremendous amount and graduated with a GPA just shy of honors. Berkeley&#8217;s computer science department was ranked number one in the country the year I graduated. I was sorely tempted to write a letter to my good friends in the admissions department to gloat, but decided to leave them in peace.

After graduation, I took a consulting position with a Costa Rican company. I moved to Costa Rica for what was originally supposed to be 6 months, and ended up staying for nearly 10 years. During that time I had the opportunity to consult in a wide variety of industries, bootstrap a [service for book lovers](http://authoralcove.com), and use a bunch of different tech stacks. A few of the highlights are listed in [my portfolio](http://grokcode.com/programmer-portfolio/).

As of July 2014, I&#8217;m back in the United States and working full-time building web and mobile apps in the health and quantified-self space.

### Tools

I am opinionated about my tools because my productivity depends on them, but opinionated isn&#8217;t the same as fanatical. Strong opinions loosely held and all that.

Emacs is my editor of choice. Even though I have been using it for many years, I still feel like an emacs novice. This is something I have been changing with more structured and deliberate practice.

I&#8217;ve used various flavors of Linux on the desktop: Red Hat, Suse, Mandrake, Ubuntu&#8230; In the end I realized that once the OS is set up and configured, I spend most of my time in bash and they are all pretty much the same. My current development machine is a MacBook Air, the first Mac I&#8217;ve owned. With the help of Homebrew and Vagrant, it&#8217;s a suitable Linux replacement with a very nice form factor.

As far as programming languages, I have had a lot of opportunity to experiment &#8211; creating large scale applications in [Java](http://grokcode.com/programmer-portfolio/#ppc-reporting-system), .NET, and [Python](http://grokcode.com/programmer-portfolio/#author-alcove) and dabbling with [PHP](http://grokcode.com/programmer-portfolio/#ab-landing-page-testing), [Common Lisp](http://grokcode.com/12/how-to-write-original-jokes-or-have-a-computer-do-it-for-you/), Scheme, [Clojure](http://grokcode.com/367/learning-clojure-with-project-euler/), Verilog, shell scripting, [Scala](http://grokcode.com/75/learning-scala-with-project-euler/), and others. At the moment, my weapon of choice is Python. It took me a while to get over the idea that whitespace is significant, but now firing up an editor and looking at Python code feels like a breath of fresh air compared to more verbose languages like Java.

There is a long list of languages and tech that I want to explore further. At the top is Ruby, Node, Python&#8217;s data science tools, and some of the JavaScript frameworks like Angular, Ember, and Backbone.

## Writer {#writer}

I have been writing longform articles about programming, development tips and guides, and reviews of books and tools for developers here on GrokCode since 2007. GrokCode was started as a way to connect with other developers despite the dearth of programmers in the small Costa Rican town where I lived. Writing has become an invaluable way for me to focus and explore my thoughts.

Some of my favorite pieces explore pain points ([Java Build Systems: A Sad State of Affairs](http://grokcode.com/538/java-build-systems-a-sad-state-of-affairs/), [Dear Python, Why Are You So Ugly](http://grokcode.com/746/dear-python-why-are-you-so-ugly/)), share useful tips ([You Should Change Your Python Shell](http://grokcode.com/811/you-should-change-your-python-shell/), [The Power of a Programming Portfolio](http://grokcode.com/58/the-power-of-a-programming-portfolio/)), or spring from research I have done to improve my productivity or become a better programmer ([The Ergonomic Keyboard Productivity Myth](http://grokcode.com/701/the-ergonomic-keyboard-productivity-myth/), [Be a Paranoid Pessimistic Programmer](http://grokcode.com/722/be-a-paranoid-pessimistic-programmer/), [Test Driven Development and the Meaning of Done](http://grokcode.com/439/test-driven-development-and-the-meaning-of-done/)).

GrokCode has been featured on Slashdot, Mashable, Daring Fireball, The Code Project, Pycoder&#8217;s Weekly and various other publications around the interwebs. Jeff Atwood and Zed Shaw have tweeted links to GrokCode, which isn&#8217;t by any means a reliable measure of the writing quality, but was still really awesome.

## World Citizen {#expat}

Aside from being a programmer and a writer, I am a world citizen. Living in two different cultures and traveling in unfamiliar places has changed my perspective on what it means to be a person and a caretaker of the Earth.
