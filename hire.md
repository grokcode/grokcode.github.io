Hi, I’m Jess. I build things that surprise and delight people, and I use data to make the world a better place. I want to work for a company that does those things too.

By trade I am a software developer. I build awesome webapps and have done a bit of data science work too. Along the way I’ve picked up enough related tech to handle the full stack: frontend, backend, devops, database administration, and even a touch of design.

My current weapon of choice is Python, but I believe in using the best tool for the job. If you are someone who enjoys long lists of keywords, here are a few that I’ve worked with most recently: Python, Django, Pytest, ES6, JQuery, Backbone, Underscore, Cordova, Git, Linux, Puppet, Ansible, Vagrant, Postgres. In the past I’ve also worked in the Java, .NET, and PHP ecosystems, but I won’t swamp you with all of those keywords too.

Also, I have a snazzy bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the University of California at Berkeley, and enjoy opportunities for continued education.

I’ve built apps for tracking habits and mood, a book discovery service for readers, data-crunching SaaS tools for internet marketers, a hosting dashboard, open source Django apps, Stripe payment integration, and a bunch of odds and ends. You can see some of the highlights in my [portfolio](http://grokcode.com/programmer-portfolio/).

Now I'm ready to move on to my next big thing.

That big thing is a full-time position with a company that moves quickly and has lean / agile in it’s DNA. It is working with a highly-collaborative, smart team. Broadly speaking, I am interested in alternative energy, quantified self, home automation, and developer tools. But there are intensely interesting problems in every industry, and if you are solving them, I would love to hear about it.

At the moment I’m in Eugene, OR, in the United States. I have a solid history of working successfully on remote teams, and strongly prefer remote positions.

If you think we could build amazing things together, let’s chat: [jess@grokcode.com](mailto:jess@grokcode.com).
