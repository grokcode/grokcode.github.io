Hi, I’m Jess. I build things that surprise and delight people, and I use data to make the world a better place. I want to work for a company that does those things too.

By trade I am a software engineer. For the last several years my focus has been architecting and building scalable, reliable backends and data pipelines. Writing code that solves a tough technical challenge is my happy place.

My current weapon of choice is Python, but I believe in using the best tool for the job. If you are someone who enjoys long lists of keywords, here are a few that I’ve worked with most recently: Python, Django, Django REST Framework, Dask, Pytest, Git, Linux, Postgres, and AWS (lambda, DynamoDB, RDS, CloudWatch, EC2, S3). In the past I’ve also worked in the JavaScript, Go, Java, .NET, and PHP ecosystems, but I won’t swamp you with all of those keywords too.

Also, I have a snazzy bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the University of California at Berkeley, and enjoy opportunities for continued education.

I’ve built FHIR compliant APIs, cloud native microservices to ingest terabytes of content for the Library of Congress, highly performant parallelized Python ETLs, REST and GraphQL APIs for the calculation of payments to Medicare and Medicaid providers, web and native apps for tracking habits and mood, a book discovery service for readers, open source Django apps, and a bunch of odds and ends. You can see some of the highlights in my [portfolio](http://grokcode.com/programmer-portfolio/).

Now I'm ready to move on to my next big thing.

That big thing is a full-time position with a company that values autonomy, integrity, and diverse perspectives. It is working with a highly-collaborative, smart team. Broadly speaking, I am interested in alternative energy, healthcare for underserved populations, quantified self, and developer tools. But there are intensely interesting problems in every industry, and if you are solving them, I would love to hear about it.

At the moment I’m in Eugene, OR, in the United States. I have a long history of working successfully on remote teams, and strongly prefer remote positions.

If you think we could build amazing things together, let’s chat: [jess@grokcode.com](mailto:jess@grokcode.com).
