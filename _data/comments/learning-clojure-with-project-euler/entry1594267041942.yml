message: "Coroner praises emergency response to sarah paino crash death\n\nPHILADELPHIA (CBS) â€” Philadelphia Police said officers responded to a call of a person with a life-threatening injury to a pedestrian shortly before 3 a.m. Saturday morning.\n\nThey say 26-year-old Casey Paino suffered critical injuries when she was struck by a motorist on Chestnut Street.\n\nPolice said the motorist swerved and ran over the victim, killing him. They say the motorist also suffered significant injuries.\n\nPolice said a preliminary investigation showed the crash was the result of a rear-end collision.\n\nPolice ask that anyone who may have seen any witnesses or know anything that could help their investigation contact police at 215-686-TIPS.\n\n\"He just lost somebody, someone very close to him. He got a bullet wound to his back. Now all they need is somebody who knows and knows something that will help them solve this problem,\" Philadelphia Fire Chief Raymond Kelly said.\n\nIt wasn't clear if the victim's car was involved in the collision. \r\n<a href=https://wooriwin.com/>카지노사이트</a>\r\n \r\nIrrigators wary of water trading\n\nMore than three-quarters of irrigators are concerned that if their business is affected by the drought, they would not be able to sell water on the market in 2015, according to a survey of 1,150 consumers conducted for the Agriculture, Forestry and Resources Department, on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"It's not ideal but if the drought goes on, it doesn't matter what farmers do,\" said an irrigator from the northern city of Chinchis. \"I may be able to sell water but nothing good will come from that.\"\n\nFor the sector, farmers do not want an outright freeze of their cash flow but \"a combination\" of more regular payment and better terms, said one in-house employee.\n\nAn estimated 30 per cent of irrigators said they had cut back on watering or added chemicals to avoid water problems this year.\n\nA government-backed scheme, the Agrosum programme, has been aimed at easing farmers' worries. The scheme allows them to cut their irrigation cost per hectare by 25 per cent or by 40 per cent, while the price of their irrigated crops will still rise.\n\nAt the same time, authorities have relaxed the conditions of licences given for water trading, giving greater flexibility to private operators to trade without a licence.\n\n\"In all areas of water management, the need of all government ministries to make provision to safeguard the water sources is constantly increasing,\" said another in-house worker who works for the government agency on drought management.\n\nWith the drought still gripping the states, the situation is not expected to get better any time soon, according to the official: \"There is a possibility of the situation worsening. There is just no way back for them.\"\n\nWith reports from Reuters \r\n<a href=https://www.water-blogged.com/>예스카지노</a>"
