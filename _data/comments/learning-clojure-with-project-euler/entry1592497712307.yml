(Aurora Entertainment Inc./NASA/YouTube via Reuters)\n\nA new study has made a bold claim about this summer's sky-wavy Aurora Borealis, the latest event to ignite speculation about this \"new age\" of galactic events. The Aurora is among the brightest and most famous of our galaxy's celestial objects and has appeared in dozens of famous films. This latest study suggests that astronomers, at least in Australia, would get some extra perspective from seeing a meteor shower like the one in May over the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nThe researchers identified five of the best views of the new event, including three that can only be captured by NASA's SkyQuest 5 instrument and one that can be seen only by satellite, which was captured in May by the European Space Agency's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (ESA).\n\nMost of the new \"Aurora Borealis,\" as some observers have labeled it, will never be seen, so astronomers are likely to have to make do with viewing from a different perspective, or with images taken by other telescopes.\n\nIf there's any good news, it's this: The latest, best observation of the new Aurora over Australia could yet be in October, when the New Zealand skies will open for the first time.\n\nIt's not the best of firsts â€” only the second-best record ever from NASA's SkyQuest, launched in 1997, was seen as seen from orbit â€” but this may still be a record for this kind of event.\n\nThe latest data suggests the Aurora â€” with a diameter of 9.3 miles (14 kilometers) â€” will pass at about 10-15 times Earth's speed of light, just a little less than the speed of light in the universe. It should peak around 3200 GMT, with maximum brightness about 1,200 times as bright as when we've ever seen the aurora seen from space.\n\n\"Auroras are really the last chance for science to know the true face of our Universe,\" says Tim White, a climate scientist at the California Institute of Technology. \"It is an incredible event to witness and to photograph, and it's exciting to realize this new generation has been born. It's wonderful to see the aurora seen from the sky, as far away as we can get.\"\n\nThe sky for Australia\n\nThe picture below shows the Aurora Borealis from a height at 3200 GMT visible from northern New South Wales (left) and Sydney (right). This picture was taken with a ground-based telescope that also provides images at about 3200 GMT (the left) fro \r\n<a href=https://www.grupo-huk.com/>온카지노</a>\r\n<a href=https://www.webix3.com/>온라인카지노</a>\r\n \r\nGrandstand digital breakfast november 1st with your favorite pod-cast.
