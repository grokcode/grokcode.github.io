message: "Criticism of sydney regional fuel price differences in 2006 and 2007\n\nThe government has been criticised for having 'pessimistic outlooks' about energy prices.\n\n\nThe average petrol price in NSW rose 10 per cent between 2002 and 2006 to almost $1.20 per litre.\n\n\nIt's estimated that this has cost the state government approximately $11.2 billion to subsidise electricity consumption and other costs.\n\nThe Government is currently under investigation by the independent commission into systemic bias in the electricity supply system to see if there are similar charges for fuel and air.\n\nUnder NSW Labor, the costs of gas were also significantly higher than in 2008.\n\n\nMr Morrison described the fuel price rise as an \"unprecedented\" price rise of over $1 per litre over a single year, and described the $11.2 billion in fuel subsidies as the largest in state history.\n\nThe gas subsidy had gone up from $2.8 billion in 2007 to $9.1 billion in 2008.\n\nIn the 2007 State of Origin election, Mr Morrison said the gas subsidy would still be there in 2009-10 and that it was time to move away from fuel price increases for fuel.\n\nOn Monday he said the issue should be up for debate in parliament.\n\nSpeaking in Perth, he said: \"I'm not one for going and making statements because it's only speculation. But what I've made on this has been based on actual numbers, not projections.\n\n\"I'm certainly comfortable with fuel prices going higher in the future. If you compare, say, petrol to gas and diesel prices to fuel - we actually got it up to $3 a litre at the beginning of this year. So if you ask me is that too high, it is.\n\n\"But is it too low? I think that you have to look at it from the perspective of all Australians, whether they use petrol or diesel.\"\n\nThere were significant increases in the petrol price in NSW between 2003 and 2006 but the rise, says Professor Andrew Marshall of Macquarie University, was driven by the price of natural gas.\n\nMr Morrison said the price of natural gas \"actually got higher than the cost of gas when we bought out a whole lot of the coal fields at the time\".\n\nThat meant that the price increase was around a third of what it normally would have been and not a huge surprise to the industry, he said.\n\nThe cost of producing natural gas is generally lower than coal and gas and therefore can cost less because it's cheaper to produce than to buy gas.\n\nHe said the increased gas cost of around 10Â¢ a litre in 2009-10 was a real increase and could drive up demand for cars in future for \"crow \r\n<a href=https://www.grupo-huk.com/>온카지노</a>\r\n<a href=https://www.thesilkwrap.com/>예스카지노</a>\r\n \r\nE timor thanks indonesia for arresting attack on Indonesian Embassy staff,\" by Andrew Cuneo, Reuters, December 4, 2015:\n\nINDONESIA's government has arrested seven people suspected of planning terrorist attacks against the Indonesian Government in order to bolster anti-terrorism activities and counter the influence of Islamic State, state-run Anadolu Agency reported.\n\nA total of 19 people including three lawyers and one nurse, were detained last week on suspicion of creating an illegal association to commit terrorist acts in order to attack the Indonesian Government, in an operation being carried out by local police and intelligence services, Anadolu Agency said on Sunday. The suspect has been identified as Abdul Aziz Ismail, 34. The charges include conspiracy to commit armed terrorism, conspiracy to commit terrorist acts and the use of a vehicle to cause the death of several persons, according to Anadolu Agency.\n\nâ€¦\n\nThe charges come after Indonesia confirmed the detention in March 2016 of its own minister, Jusuf Ahok, accused of inciting anti-Muslim violence. The government said Ahok was being investigated over alleged support for anti-Islam groups such as the Jakarta Council of Imams and a group that has links to the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nAhok is being investigated over alleged support for anti-Islam groups including the Jakarta Council of Imams and a group that has links to the Muslim Brotherhood\n\nHowever, according to Anadolu Agency, which cited three senior officials in the Ministry of Home Affairs as confirming Ahok's detention:\n\nJusuf Ahok is not part of the investigation.\n\nA man charged with allegedly incitement for terrorist groups is one of those detained.\n\nThe Ministry of Home Affairs is in charge of the security sector and does not have the power to detain or dismiss people.\n\nA court has appointed a third public prosecutor after Ahok's arrest.\n\nâ€¦\n\nAccording to one official quoted by Anadolu Agency, Ahok will probably be questioned about two \"recent terrorist acts,\" the latest being the attack on the Indonesian Armed Forces Headquarters (Binjang) in Bali on Friday.\n\nAhok also faces one related to the attack, with the police having charged the same person with terror funding as the accused Ahok.\n\nAn individual at the ministry who spoke to Anadolu said: \"We have arrested five people for allegedly instigating terrorism. They are currently in police custody and there will be an announcement later.\"\n\nThe officials also noted that they cannot rule out the possibility of Ahok being arrested again later.\n\nMeanwhile, reports emerged Friday that another arrest made on a domestic terrorism charge took place at an Indonesian army camp. At least one police official confirmed to RIA Novosti that soldier"
