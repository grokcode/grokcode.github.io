message: "Hello my friend. I want to apologize for my English, I hardly know it. My name is Alexander, I live in a small town in Russia. I work 17 hours a day and earn $ 200 a month. I have a wife, she's pregnant - we're going to have a baby soon -) This is a cry of the soul, I do not know what to do, we are now renting an apartment, we do not have our own housing. If you help me, I will be grateful to You for the rest of my life. I'm ashamed to ask for help from people I don't know personally. But the situation is now hopeless for me. In 3 months, I need to raise $100,000!!! Every dollar you donate is important to me. I do not know what else to write. I'm asking For your help. This is not a spam newsletter. This is the cry of the soul. I am ashamed to leave my data, I know that there is a bitcoin currency. I have a bitcoin wallet, you can see how much I have collected. I don't need more than $100,000. I just want my child to grow up in his apartment. Please help me. I don't know what to do. If you have read my message and are ready to support my family, transfer as much as you can to this bitcoin address 15sG4Y8aeTLEMaovvcpYaFSeispBcGXUrR. I am sure that the world is not without good people. thank you very much.... \r\n \r\nhttps://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/15sG4Y8aeTLEMaovvcpYaFSeispBcGXUrR \r\n \r\n \r\nPlease excuse me if I caused you any inconvenience with my message. i'm sorry.."
