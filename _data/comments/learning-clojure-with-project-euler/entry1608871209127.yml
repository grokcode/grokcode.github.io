message: "The coronavirus pandemic has phoney universities to swap to haughtiness learning. community service essay examples <a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>thesis staement</a> essay service for college. \r\nBut what is happening in present can be called an emergency delivery of content to audience members in isolation . A lot of varsities  and the professors themselves were not ready for the transition to online. According to a 2019 HSE study, University professors with an academic degree rate their level of proficiency in remote technologies at 3.2 points out of five. One in four persons has never utilized remote video services get  in webinars or video conferences in the past three years. \r\nBut professors are not required to own online learning technologies. They were simply not prepared for this, although education and its new methods are the main function of universities. Try to oblige the surgeon to do their work in self-isolation. Let him explain to the patient via Skype how to remove his appendicitis. It sounds crazy. Thus, the resourcefulness with which educators adapt to the remote format is commendable. \r\n \r\nSome of the time it is funny. Colleagues from regional universities told that some professors asked to write conspectuses by hand and send them scans for according.In present, people communicate remotely in real time thanks to new digital technologies, students can \"raise their hands\" with a single button, they can write with a finger on a tablet as on a blackboard, and they are told: \"Please write a handwritten summary and send the scan.\" Or, for example, this case: a physical education educator asked students to shoot five-minute videos where they perform physical exercises. In spite of the fact that remote physical excercises can be more originative, for example, you can make a selection of ready-made videos on YouTube, find checklists in the public domain, and teach them to play sports in self-isolation, while you can't go anywhere anywhere. \r\n \r\nUniversity teachers are faced with a lack of guidance and difficulties in dealing with organizational matters. Some of them conduct lessons on Skype, someone -in Zoom, someone only sends lectures to WhatsApp. Some professors record lessons on a webcam and send them to students. The quality of such materials is minimal, and it is hard to perceive them. At least because the content on YouTube, which students are used to, is shot and edited professionally and the viewer is spoiled by the quality of video materials. \r\nThere are also difficulties with monitoring attendance. Some teachers ask you to put a \" + \" in the chat, others require  you to turn on Webcams and take screenshots of students. Against the background of all the misunderstandings and troubles, one element of academic life remains unchanged - assessment. Students don't get an educational experience on campus, but they will get grades, even formal ones. \r\n<a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>honours thesis</a> \r\nLearning online from home does not have these disadvantages, because it is built on a carefully designed learning process in an electronic information and educational environment. Professors have instructions, manuals, memos,checklists, templates for emails and notifications, and even presentations. Everything is thought out here-from the screen saver before the lesson to the slide with homework."
