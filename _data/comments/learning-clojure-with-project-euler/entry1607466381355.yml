On the western bank is the Gandhi Ashram at Sabarmati, which displays the spiritual leaderвЂ™s living quarters and artifacts. Across the river, the Calico Museum of Textiles, once a cloth merchant's mansion, has a significant collection of antique and modern fabrics. \r\n \r\nhttps://softwareking.tw/entry/outlook ost change to pst.html -  Ahmedabad"
