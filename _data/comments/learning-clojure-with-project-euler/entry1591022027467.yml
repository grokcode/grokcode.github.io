message: "Bishop touts return to individual contracts as a way to improve players' health. He wants to get back to that point as the season continues.\n\n\"I mean, the main thing is our players have to get back to the next level. You got to get your game up and play at a high level. I know they're working hard to get there. We know it and we're excited about it. We've gotta get better, and they've got to stay here on and play up to the standard you set for yourself,\" he said.\n\nHe was referring to a statement he had made Friday during his weekly presentation of his vision for Minnesota's roster that the Vikings have reached the salary cap and he hopes to achieve that goal within the next season and next two seasons.\n\nBishop said he also would like to see a more competitive culture in the room for improving players.\n\nHe acknowledged that, on the rare occasions when players have played as poorly as they have this season, the general manager can correct them and move them back up the depth chart.\n\nThe coach also wants to see more of his star players play well.\n\n\"We're trying to get some more players at the quarterback position and we have some real guys. We don't have to take one of them for granted. I'm proud of our quarterback group. I know they have their work cut out for them, but we want to get it done,\" Bishop said.\n\nThe Vikings have the worst record in the NFL with an 8-3-2 mark but have won their last seven games, including two wins over Green Bay and St. Louis.\n\nMinnesota plays four regular-season games and the winner of Sunday's game will face Pittsburgh next week, the first game since the Vikings began their season two weeks ago.\n\nSt. Louis (10-7) and Pittsburgh (7-10) are the only teams in the league with losing records. Pittsburgh has had a combined record of 23-32-3 over its last 10 games after scoring its only touchdown over its first four games of the season. \r\n<a href=https://www.shamsbim.com/>더킹카지노</a>\r\n<a href=https://wooriwin.com/>예스카지노</a>\r\n \r\nPair charged over kambalda house blaze\n\nThe incident was reported around 1 am.
