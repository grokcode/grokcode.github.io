An animal can be stored for up to 10 years if stored according to the strict standards of live export regulations. Animals can also be sold after a month if it's possible to contact animal officials within 24 hours. For live export regulations on meat, milk, eggs and other products, please contact your local animal handling authority (AWA) or meat or milk marketing bureau. In rare cases, live export is forbidden after 2 years as many countries do not want a return of wildlife.\n\nSome countries have implemented special standards regarding live export as well. The following are the live export regulations:\n\nTurkey:\n\nMeat of animals slaughtered beyond 48 hours of gestation (exceptions are permitted for veal and poultry) must not be sold on the market. If an animal is slaughtered prior to its 48 hours, it must remain stored for 36 hours after sale. If a woman's male animal is killed prior to its 48 hours, it must remain stored for 36 hours after sale.\n\nAnimals slaughtered within 2 weeks of birth â€“ for example, if a female rabbit has been found dead inside her cage during an autopsy after 4 weeks of gestation, and an autopsy does not reveal any sign of trauma, it must not be sold until a month later. If the body of the female rabbit is found by a veterinarian within 2 weeks of the time her body was discovered by an autopsy, it is illegal to sell such a rabbit. If the body is found after the 2 weeks, however, it is legal to sell the body after it has matured a month and a half. There is no restriction on selling of female rabbit carcasses.\n\nIf a female rabbit was found in her own cage by an autopsy on a date outside the 2 weeks, it must be sold within 48 hours. If it is discovered after the 2 weeks, it is legal to sell it after 8 weeks. If a female rabbit that is found later by an autopsy is not the same one that was found by an autopsy, it is illegal to sell it if the male rabbit still lives with the female. A rabbit that was found by an autopsy later in life is still alive but she cannot be sold unless her body is preserved. For live export regulations, please visit your local AWA or local Meat Marketing Bureau.\n\nThe following countries also prohibit live export from live export: Albania, Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt, Fiji, France, Gabon, Greece, Germany, Greece, Guam, Greenland, Guatemala, Guinea, Hungary, Iceland, India, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, Kuwait, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania"
