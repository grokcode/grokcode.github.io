message: "Bus drivers union hopes to protect services and safety at some points of this process, said Scott Anderson, union spokesman.\n\n\"We understand that this process would take time, but we want to give ourselves an opportunity and do it right so we can preserve what the drivers have always known and been passionate about.\"\n\nThe union has already submitted about 40 pages of written statements, including written responses to questions about where contracts are being signed and where contracts go if drivers agree to back out of their contracts. The union said it will provide more information on Thursday.\n\n\"These are very delicate steps, but they allow us to do what we know we need to do and we want to do it to the best of our ability,\" said Tom O'Shea, president of the Northbrook United Auto Workers, whose members are based in Cottage Grove.\n\nWorkers' groups have been meeting with representatives from the companies to discuss possible contract changes and said they plan to ask for similar meetings at other plants as they do at Cottage Grove.\n\nEmployees at the Huntington and Northbrook plants are paid base wages based on their hours worked to union standards and about 80% of their base wages go toward union dues. A $2,000 payment from the union, about $80 to workers who join the union, could help cover most of the union's costs, O'Shea said.\n\n\"This is something that we will consider,\" said Dan Olinger, vice president for economic services for Huntington.\n\nThe union is seeking to have the agreements changed but has not yet submitted a request to the board, and Olinger said they will not ask for that change until after talks with the company have been completed.\n\nThe union has held a series of discussions this week with representatives from each company on the labor issue, and some members have indicated they want to join the collective bargaining process if it means protecting employees.\n\n\"If they want to protect our jobs and their jobs, then we don't know what they want to do,\" said Olinger.\n\nUnion leaders have been seeking a meeting with company representatives so they can present a proposal, and some are optimistic about getting that.\n\n\"If we can make it look like a reasonable proposal, they will hear our side of the story,\" said Mike Balsley, president of the Cottage Grove Unions Local 226.\n\nHowever, the Cottage Grove Union Association told the Press-Citizen it has the right to ask for additional concessions from the companies as well.\n\n\"We have been asked to provide additional information that is essential to an overall discussion,\" said David Leechman, a spokesman for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 442, which represents 5,000 union members at  \r\n<a href=https://wooriwin.com/>카지노사이트</a>\r\n \r\n \r\n<a href=https://www.webix3.com/>바카라</a>"
