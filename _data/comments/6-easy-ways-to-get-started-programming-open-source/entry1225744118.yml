  karma: 0, message: '@jryan I''m using mostly Suse at the moment, and in the past
    have used primarily Red Hat and Mandrake.  I''m fairly comfortable with the command
    line, so to be honest I don''t notice a whole lot of differences between the distros
    I''ve used.  I also try to minimize the amount of effort I put in to install and
    config issues by just buying my boxes with linux preinstalled. I guess I''ve lost
    most of my patience for and wonder at fiddling with installs and setting up the
    configs - although it has gotten easier in recent years, I still try to avoid
    it and focus on, well...just getting shit done.', name: Jess Johnson, parent: 0,
