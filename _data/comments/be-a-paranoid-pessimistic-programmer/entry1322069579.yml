    \ with technical detail and not telling them enough about the work so that they\
    \ don't really understand what they are paying for. This is something that I still\
    \ struggle with. And it's one reason why I prefer working with clients who are\
    \ fairly technical - they have a better understanding of the challenges involved\
    \ in a project without me having to do as much explaining.\r\n\r\nI think there\
    \ is a big difference between dropping problems in a client's lap, and coming\
    \ to them later with a list of problems plus possible solutions to them all. It\
    \ is almost always better not to mention a bunch of problems unless you already\
    \ have some ideas for solving them. Or if it is something that can be resolved\
    \ without the client's input, that is even better. Although as you say, it is\
    \ a good idea to bring it up later so the client knows what they are paying for.",
