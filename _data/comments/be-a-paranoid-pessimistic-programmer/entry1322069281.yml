    I''ve seen systems crash because a whole load of bits of code which, by themselves,
    should work perfectly, don''t when they''re all stuck together is mindblowing.
    Just a little intelligence and a few extra checks and error handlers would''ve
    saved the day... but no: the programmers were too optimistic, and guess what:
    they were wrong.', name: Dan Sutton, parent: 0, post_ID: 722, subscribe: N, url: 'http://www.opwernby.com'}
