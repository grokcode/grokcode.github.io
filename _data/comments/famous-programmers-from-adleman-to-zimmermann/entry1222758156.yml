    definitely you''re not as good as any male programmer, you''re most probably worse
    programmer than a significant number of male programmers who are well above average,
    and at the same time you''re most probably worse than much smaller number of female
    programmers. It''s worth noting though that there are a lot of male programmers
    who are far worse than you... much more than bad women programmers. This is because
    women are more ''average'' and men are more ''spread out'', there are more men
    geniuses and more men idiots than there are women geniuses and idiots. This has
    nothing to do with sexism, feminism, any stereotype and all that politically correct
    bs, this has everything to do with the *fact* that women and men are *different*.',
