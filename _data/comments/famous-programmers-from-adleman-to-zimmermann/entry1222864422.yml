    \ transsexual woman under a separate category from \u201Cmen\u201D and \u201C\
    women.\u201D I mean, Dani\u2019s transsexuality is certainly worth noting; does\
    \ beginning your career living as a man and later transitioning to your true identity\
    \ help or hinder you as a woman in computer science? But please, it\u2019s insulting\
    \ to imply that transsexual people are somehow sexless, neither \u201Cmen\u201D\
    \ nor \u201Cwomen\u201D; it\u2019s the sort of preconception we spend our lives\
    \ fighting.\r\n\r\nDani\u2019s a woman; when she received, posthumously, the Academy\
    \ of Interactive Arts and Sciences Lifetime Achievement Award, the highest honor\
    \ in videogames, they honored her identity and referred to her throughout as a\
    \ woman and nothing else. Wil Wright, a colleague, gave the speech in her stead.\r\
    \n\r\nThanks! It\u2019s a great article!", name: Tina Russell, parent: 0, post_ID: 37,
