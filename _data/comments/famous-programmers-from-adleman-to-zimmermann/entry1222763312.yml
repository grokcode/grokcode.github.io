    If you think the 0.5 of a person was referring to a transsexual, then you jumped\
    \ to a conclusion rather than reading and understanding the article.\r\n\r\nI\
    \ have to agree, though, that it'd be nicer to refer to someone who chooses to\
    \ live as a woman full time as a woman rather than as a transsexual or similar.\
    \ Anyone who thinks that things are as definite as there being just two sexes\
    \ is rather oversimplifying the matter. Everyone\u2019s at least a bit different,\
    \ and while classification can be useful, unnecessary overuse can lead to discrimination\
    \ against individuals.\r\n\r\n@ Lawlz, Esteban\r\nSheesh, grow up.\r\n\r\n@ ghrom\r\
    \nDo you have any (scientific) evidence to back up your comments? They sound distinctly\
    \ like opinion, rather than fact. How would you even go about assessing who is\
    \ a good programmer and who is not?", name: Loz, parent: 0, post_ID: 37, subscribe: N,
