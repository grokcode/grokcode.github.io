    but it makes them almost unreadable, especially when the legend does NOT use images.  The
    use of images means that each pie slice actually has a variety of shades, and
    when you have over a dozen color in the legend it then becomes impossible to match
    the colors in the legend to the slice of the pie.  Sorry. Solid colors *do* have
    their place and I think pie charts is one of those places, since it makes them
    more easily readable.  My 2 cents.', name: Craig Landrum, parent: 0, post_ID: 37,
