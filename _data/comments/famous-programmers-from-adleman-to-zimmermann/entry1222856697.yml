    free to google for it, feel free to open your eyes and see it for yourself. As
    for the assessment of who is a good programmer - you missed the whole point. There
    will be more male ''good programmers'' than female ''good programmers'' regardless
    of the criteria you use. Mind you, there will be more male ''bad programmers''
    regardless of the criteria, try to understand it. We''re different and there''s
    nothing ''bad'' in it.', name: ghrom, parent: 0, post_ID: 37, subscribe: Y, url: 'http://ghrom.com'}
