    \ about women being overall more \"average\" and men having more above/below numbers?\
    \ What a crock. Distribution curves don't work like that, especially in comparison\
    \ across gender or other variable lines. Average is average, bell curves are bell\
    \ curves. \r\n\r\nWhat we are seeing here is a simple extension of the numbers:\
    \ more men go into the field overall, so there are ultimately more famous/accomplished\
    \ men. If the volume of women were higher overall, you'd see a higher number of\
    \ famous women profiled. Simple.  \r\n\r\nAlthough, I think women need better\
    \ personal PR in order to even get into the consideration set when these types\
    \ of studies are being done. With women being generally considered more collaborative\
    \ as workers, there may be a bias against the \"female\" work style (profiling\
    \ individual vs team accomplishments).", name: trxeebelden, parent: 0, post_ID: 37,
