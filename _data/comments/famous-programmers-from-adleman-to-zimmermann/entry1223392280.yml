    \ or whatever it's unlikely that M-&gt;F transsexuals are *exactly like* women-from-birth-on\
    \ in the relevant ways. But ... well, let's just say that the only TS person I\
    \ know well (who, incidentally, happens to be an absolutely first-rate programmer,\
    \ though not a famous one) would probably be pretty peeved at being categorized\
    \ as neither-male-nor-female.", name: g, parent: 0, post_ID: 37, subscribe: N,
