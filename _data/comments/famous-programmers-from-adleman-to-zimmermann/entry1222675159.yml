  karma: 0, message: '@Sandy: The mistery is actually quite simple to solve. The reason
    that in your office 20% of workers are women and they are as competent as men
    is that as a general rule men are both ''better'' and ''worse'' than women. In
    the population of men you will find that more are much dumber than average and
    at the same time there are more who are smarter. Men are more ''spread out'' if
    you will, women are more ''average''. This explains why there are less dumb women
    programmers and less geniuses as well, and why in an average office women cope
    as well as men. HTH.', name: ghrom, parent: 0, post_ID: 37, subscribe: Y, url: 'http://ghrom.com'}
