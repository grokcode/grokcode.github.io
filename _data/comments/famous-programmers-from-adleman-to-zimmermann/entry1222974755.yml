    \ Paul, Ralph, dvorak  Alright I'll stop it with the trees then. In the future\
    \ I'll also be more careful about labeling the graphs so colorblind people will\

    \ to be offensive.  I find it interesting that the gender split among famous programmers\
    \ is so different from the general population and from the group of \"normal\"\
    \ programmers.  3 transgendered people and 7 women out of a group of 222 - that\
    \ is *very* different from what you will see walking down the street.  I split\
    \ transgendered people out as a separate group to show that difference in the\
    \ gender split, not because they are \"sexless.\"", name: Jess Johnson, parent: 0,
