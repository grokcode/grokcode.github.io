message: "cartierlovejesduas Hi Diane, I am on Little Hickoryo right now and just came off the beach after walking for three hours this morning. I didnâ€™t have a big enough bag for all the shells that were just sitting there waiting for someone to take them home. I was the only person on the beach for the ffirst 2 hours. I as sooooo much fun. I found many fighting conchs as well, put back at lease 30 live ones. Was licky enough to bring home many dufferent colorful conchs, many fighting welks sizing from 1 inch to 12 inches, apple murex, sharks eyes, lots of coral, calico clams and even found sevral sunray venus still attached. There were quiet a few bright orange scallops. I also found several larger clams that were in various shades of blues, very pretty. I still have to put Sanibel first on my beach list but have really enjoyed Little Hickory beach this week ( EXCEPT FOR THE RAIN). We are across the stree from the public beach access immediately after crossing the bridge coming onto Little Hickory. Glad you also had a great experience here Diane.\r\n <a href=\"http://www.finejewelryshop.ru/fr/sweet-van-cleef-bracelet-replica-c10_13/\" >copie van cleef clover bracelet</a> [url=http://www.finejewelryshop.ru/fr/sweet-van-cleef-bracelet-replica-c10_13/]copie van cleef clover bracelet[/url]"
