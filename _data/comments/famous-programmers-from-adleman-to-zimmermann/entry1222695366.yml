    \ determine it? In humans a single gene (SRY) on the Y chromosone acts as a signal\
    \ to develop maleness. But this is not for certain. There are XX males and XY\
    \ females found in the general population. See also Intersexuality - the state\
    \ of a living thing of a gonochoristic species whose sex chromosomes, genitalia,\
    \ and/or secondary sex characteristics are determined to be neither exclusively\
    \ male nor female. An organism with intersex may have biological characteristics\
    \ of both the male and female sexes.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersexuality\"\
