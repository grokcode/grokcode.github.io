    \ 4 are transsexual\" is that it shows that being raised as a boy is an <em>enormous</em>\
    \ advantage where a programming career is concerned.\r\n\r\nEven people who claim\
    \ the M-&gt;F transsexual women aren't women at least have to admit they have\
    \ an awful lot in common with women, enough to endure a lot of bigotry to live\
    \ that way.  So it's not something about feminine personalities that turns women\
    \ away, or even so much barriers in adulthood; the killer obstacles are the ones\
    \ you hit as a girl.  If you can sneak past those, because your parents and teachers\
    \ and kids on the playground think you're a boy (rightfully or not), you've avoided\
    \ past the hardest part.  \r\n\r\nSo let's raise kids carefully!", name: Catherine
