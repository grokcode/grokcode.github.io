    \ you've put into it.  If you've got time and energy, it would be brilliant to\
    \ have an update that can grab avatars from other sources in addition to Gravatar,\
    \ in case people already have them.\r\n\r\n@Kelly and @wwwindi, I think all you\
    \ have to do is upload your 80x80 jpgs into the image folder (plugins/ravatar/parts).\
    \  That way you'll have control over what bits get shown.  At least, that seemed\
    \ to work for me when I tried it.", name: Kath, parent: 0, post_ID: 7, subscribe: Y,
