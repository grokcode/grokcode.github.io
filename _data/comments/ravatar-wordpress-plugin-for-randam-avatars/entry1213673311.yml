    \ plugin ideas out there. All it needs is a little tweak... I read your dialogue\
    \ with Evern, who wanted non-cropped random avatars. Allowing people to simply\
    \ have an uncropped random avatar assigned to guests from a directory would be\
    \ great.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'd just like to get some small .gifs going for mine.\
    \ I'm not too good with code, so it's a trial-and-error process... Whatever Evern\
    \ did to make it work ain't workin' for me. I'm trying to figure out what I can\
    \ break that would stop the generation process and just return whole avatars,\
    \ and possibly allow animated .gifs. 'Don't suppose I could bother you for some\
    \ pointers could I?\r\n\r\n\r\n@Sheta: I think I know what your problem might\
    \ be (hope you're not still dealing with too much trouble by now). I had the same\
    \ thing happening to me, where images wouldn't appear on public comments but they\
    \ would show up when managing comments. It turned out that it was my theme's comments.php\
    \ file that was the cause. Try switching to a different theme; if avatars show\
    \ up then it's probably that your current theme's comments.php file is missing\
    \ this:  Once I figured out where to put that, it was all fixed.", name: Gatero,
