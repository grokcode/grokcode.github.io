  I am new to building internet sites and I was wanting to know if having your
  blog title relevant to your content really that vital? I notice your title,
  "%BLOGTITLE% " does seem to be spot on with what your website is about but, I
  prefer to keep my title less content descriptive and based more around site
  branding. Would you think this is a good idea or bad idea? Any kind of help
  would be greatly valued.
