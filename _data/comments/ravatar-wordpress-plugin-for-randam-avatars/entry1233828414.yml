    \ Ravatars to show in the recent comments sidebar.\r\n\r\nOn a more positive note,\
    \ I can say that Ravatars works great (except for my recent comments issue of\
    \ not showing the Ravatar) with Wordpress 2.7 and my Wordpress theme veryplaintxt\
    \ 4.6.1. The recent comments plugin I mentioned in my last post seems to work\
    \ very well and gives the administrator a host of options over the standard widget.\r\
    \n\r\nThank you for your efforts! I hope a future update may resolve these issues.",
