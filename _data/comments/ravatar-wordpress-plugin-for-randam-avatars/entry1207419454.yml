  karma: 0, message: '@JunuMagic It sounds like the line where you call ravatar_show
    is outside of the comments loop.  Try finding the start of your comments loop
    and then the closing } that matches with it.  There might be many nested matching
    brackets inside of the loop that you can disregard.  Not sure how much sense that
    makes if you are not a programmer, but I hope it helps.', name: Jess Johnson,
