    \ your own images.  Look for the call to get_avatar() in the sidebar.  It will\
    \ look something like this: get_avatar($comment, 32)  The number at the end is\
    \ the size the avatar should be. Unfortunetely, if you have avatars of 2 different\
    \ sizes for the same person, they will be different parts of the same source image,\
    \ so they won't look the same.\r\n\r\n@explorish Try adding the code get_avatar($comment,\
    \ 32) inside the comment loop code for the recent comments.  Change the 32 to\
    \ whatever size you would like the avatar to be.", name: Jess Johnson, parent: 0,
