    \ sure when it stopped, cuz I've had a lot of various issues lately and it escaped\
    \ my notice til the other day. I followed the advice above, including editing\
    \ my htaccess file, and completely broke my site and had to go so far as delete\
    \ the entire site and start over (including uninstalling Wordpress three times!).\
    \ I finally stumbled upon the answer to the break for the site (had to do with\
    \ wp_redirection plugin, and I had to drop the database tables for that plugin\
    \ for my site to start showing up again; I'd been getting a blank page.)\r\n\r\
    \nBut after all that, ravatars still do not work. I'm using the newest version\
    \ of Wordpress with a fresh, clean install of the latest Ravatars plugin. I've\
    \ already tried removing all other comment-related plugins, and when it didn't\
    \ help I put them back. All other plugins I'm using are: \r\n\r\nAdmin Drop Down\

    \ less essential plugins for it, but nothing that is important. For the record,\
    \ I have tried deleting all plugins and starting with Ravatars, and it didn't\
    \ work alone, either.", name: Sheta, parent: 0, post_ID: 7, subscribe: N, url: 'http://spiritcompanion.com'}
