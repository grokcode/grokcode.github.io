message: "RENTON, Wash. (AP) 锟?Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin couldn't keep from taking a jab at former San Francisco 49ers and new Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh.\r\nIRVING, Texas (AP) 锟?Dallas linebacker Rolando McClain and defensive end Jeremy Mincey returned to practice Friday after missing the first two workouts of the week dealing with concussion-like symptoms following a wild-card win over Detroit.\r\nAfter Tom Brady failed <a href=http://www.wholesalejersyeschinanfl.us.com/>Cheap NFL Jerseys China</a> to move New England (1-1) for a first down on three series, backup Jimmy Garoppolo led five scoring drives, starting <a href=http://www.cheapnfljerseysclub.us.com/>Wholesale Jerseys</a> with his scramble and 24-yard scoring pass to Chris Harper.\r\n\"We're not planning on bringing anybody in at this time,\" Harbaugh said. \"We think we have a lot of depth there. We've got some young players I thought stepped up tonight, so we'll see how those guys do.\"\r\nDivision C\r\nDiggs leaped <a href=http://www.cheapjerseysnflelite.us.com/>wholesale jerseys</a> from just inside the 5 and landed in the end zone with a 36-yard, go-ahead touchdown in the third quarter, helping the Minnesota Vikings rally for a <a href=http://www.cheapnfljerseyschinateam.us.com/>Cheap NFL Jerseys</a> 28-19 win over the Detroit Lions on Sunday."
