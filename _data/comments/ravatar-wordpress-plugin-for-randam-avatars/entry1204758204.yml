    folder to be automatically cropped, can i edit the php file in a way so it doesn''t
    crop the image? meaning just randomly assign avatards to visitors according to
    their emails without cropping the images i provide? all images i placed in the
    folder are of the same size.', name: Evern, parent: 0, post_ID: 7, subscribe: N,
