    \ in the core. Best not to go tinkering. I will find a recent comments plugin\
    \ and test it out.\r\n\r\nI have your ravatars plugin set up to choose among 48X48\
    \ jpegs that I have in the parts folder. I fooled around until I could get just\
    \ the whole image instead of a cropped part.\r\n\r\nThis plugin of yours is brilliant,\
    \ and is the only plugin out there that I know of that can customize default avatars\
    \ to a blog's content. I have a medieval blog theme and my custom designed avatars,\
    \ or should I say ravatars, are all medieval themed as well.\r\n\r\nDo you take\
    \ donations?", name: Ricky, parent: 0, post_ID: 7, subscribe: N, url: ''}
