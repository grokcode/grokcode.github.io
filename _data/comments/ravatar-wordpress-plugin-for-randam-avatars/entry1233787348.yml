  karma: 0, message: '@Ricky We discovered that the sidebar recent comments loop is
    part of wordpress core.  Since its generally a bad idea to modify the core files,
    the best solution would be to find a plugin that implements the recent comments
    feature.  Then if that plugin doesn''t support avatars, you could modify the plugin
    so that it contains the get_avatar() code.  I haven''t personally used any recent
    comments plugins, so I can''t make any good recommendations there, but please
    let me know if you find one that works.', name: Jess Johnson, parent: 0, post_ID: 7,
