    \ auto placement feature.  If you really want to to customize the location you\
    \ will need to know some PHP to edit your theme.  The comments loop is a section\
    \ of code that loops over and displays each of the comments. Since I don't know\
    \ how your theme works, I can't give you specific line numbers for where the comments\
    \ loop starts, but in my theme the comments loop starts with this line:   \r\n\
    \r\n<?php foreach ($comments as $comment) : ?>\r\n\r\nHope that helps.", name: Jess
