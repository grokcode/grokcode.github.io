    \ is really the job of your theme.  The directions in the post above are all for\
    \ pre 2.5 which is a bit confusing.  I'll edit them when I get a chance.\r\n\r\
    \nIn order to edit the size of the ravatars, look in your theme for the line get_avatar.\
    \ In the default theme the line is in coments.php and says get_avatar($comment,\
    \ 32) Change 32 to the size you would like the avatars to be.  You can also add\
    \ your html before and after get_avatar to help position the avatars.\r\n\r\n\
    And thanks to everybody for their patience while getting the kinks sorted out.",
