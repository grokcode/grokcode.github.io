    \ 80 pixels, and all of the images in the plugins/ravatar/parts directory are\
    \ 80 pixels, it should try to crop the image, but since it can't be cropped it\
    \ should just return the original image.  It isn't doing that?\r\n\r\nWell anyway,\
    \ it shouldn't be that hard to do it in the code.  On lines 258 and 259 you should\
    \ have \r\n$width_off = (hexdec(substr ($seed, 6, 5)) % ($width - AVATAR_SIZE));\r\
    \n$height_off = (hexdec(substr ($seed, 11, 5)) % ($height - AVATAR_SIZE));\r\n\
    \r\nChange those lines to\r\n$width_off = 0;\r\n$height_off = 0;", name: Jess
