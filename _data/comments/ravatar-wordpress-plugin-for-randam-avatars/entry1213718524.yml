    \ corner of a ravatar displays the image while the rest is black. The problem\
    \ lies in the line: define(\"AVATAR_SIZE\",           '80');  on line 15 of ravatars.php.\
    \ Change this to the desired size (in Sarahe's case, 100), so that it matches\
    \ the setting. When the value matches the avatar size of the theme, it should\
    \ return the image in the right size... or at least, it fixed my problem when\
    \ I changed that.\r\n\r\nKeep up the good work jess, I'll be watching for the\
