    \ the file but instead of putting the whole ravatar directory in the plug ins\
    \ folder, I just placed the ravatar.php file and parts directory. After looking\
    \ at the code, I realized that the images were being generated but the browser\
    \ was looking for them in the wrong place, so I modified line 402 to:\r\n$url\
    \ = 'http://www.friendsofmofo.com/wp/wp-content/plugins/cache' . \"/$seed.png\"\
    ; and it is working great.\r\n\r\nJust wanted to share in case someone comes along\
    \ with the same problem/mistake.\r\n\r\nGreat plug in and if it works out I will\
    \ be happily donating for your work,\r\nall the best,\r\ns.", name: Shawn T, parent: 0,
