    \n\r\nA couple of questions left:\r\n\r\n1) How can I add borders to my ravatar\
    \ images?\r\n\r\n2) Can you determine what area of the full images in parts are\
    \ sampled?  I would like to (in photoshop) predetermine the size of the images\
    \ - make them consistent. I would like to do this because I would like most of\
    \ the image to be visiible, not too cropped and abstract. For example, I have\
    \ a snowflake image that fills the entire image frame, and I would like to see\
    \ most of it instead of just a fragment after Ravatars samples the image.\r\n\r\
    \nThanks!!!\r\nI will donate soon -\r\nWWWindi", name: wwwindi, parent: 0, post_ID: 7,
