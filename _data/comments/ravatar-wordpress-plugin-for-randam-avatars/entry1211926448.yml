    \ a bunch of 100x100 pics into the parts directory of ravatar but when they are\
    \ generated they only take a corner of the picture and then the rest of the avatar\
    \ is black. So i end with only one corner of the avatar being a picture, and it's\
    \ not even a good corner. How do I fix this? can you not have the whole image\
    \ used as an avatar?\r\nAlso I only have a new site, with only 2 users (only day\
    \ 2 of site!) and I thought maybe if I cleared the cache (which I had to create\
    \ as there was no cache directory) it might generate me a new avatar, and now\
    \ I am getting nothing! no avatars for me or the other user who never had one\
    \ generated before.\r\nI'm confused help!!", name: Sarahe, parent: 0, post_ID: 7,
