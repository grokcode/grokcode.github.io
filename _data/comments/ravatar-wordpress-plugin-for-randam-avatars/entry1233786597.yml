    \ I have the exact same problem. I cannot find the comment loop for the recent\
    \ comments in my theme. I too am using the recent comment widget. I looked through\
    \ functions, comments, sidebar...\r\n\r\n\"@Jess how can i make the avatars show\
    \ in the \u201Crecent comments\u201D widget? i am using neoclassical theme, i\
    \ think i need to tweak it myself.\r\nthanks a lot in advance!\"\r\n\r\n\"@explorish\
    \ Try adding the code get_avatar($comment, 32) inside the comment loop code for\
    \ the recent comments. Change the 32 to whatever size you would like the avatar\
    \ to be.\"", name: Ricky, parent: 0, post_ID: 7, subscribe: N, url: ''}
