    I currently have Gravatar support disabled.  I suspect the problem stems from
    a change in the gravatars API.  Gravatars was recently <a href="http://blog.gravatar.com/2008/03/14/big-changes-afoot/"
    rel="nofollow">totally rewritten</a>.  I''ll be updating the Ravatars plugin within
    the next few days to fix the issue.  Thanks once again for the feedback!', name: Jess
