    source code.  Looking at the recent comments plugin code, go to line 1314 and
    change $comment_gravatar_url  to $ravatar_get($comment->comment_author_email,
    50) where 50 is the size you are using for the ravatars.  No idea if this will
    work or not, and I can''t test since the plugin requires an version of wordpress
    that I don''t use, but its worth a shot.', name: Jess Johnson, parent: 0, post_ID: 7,
