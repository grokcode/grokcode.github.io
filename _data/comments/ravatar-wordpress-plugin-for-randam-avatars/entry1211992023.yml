    that they are the size that the theme specifies - it won''t resize anything.  You
    can have the whole image used as the avatar, but the source images need to be
    the same size as the avatars in the theme for that to work.  I''m not sure why
    part would be black if there isn''t any black in the source images.  Strange.
    Do you have an example?  Or a link where there are comments, but the avatars aren''t
    showing up?', name: Jess Johnson, parent: 0, post_ID: 7, subscribe: N, url: 'http://grokcode.com'}
