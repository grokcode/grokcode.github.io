  karma: 0, message: '@wwwindi Sorry about the troubles you are having.  You''re right,
    you won''t see the autoplacement option in that version of wordpress.  Looking
    at your site, I see that it is creating ravatars, although I''m not sure if they
    are from the default images or from the custom images you uploaded.  I would go
    ahead and modify your theme to put a call to  ravatar_show($comment->comment_author_email);
    in your comments loop.  Are you able to see ravatars after making that change?',
