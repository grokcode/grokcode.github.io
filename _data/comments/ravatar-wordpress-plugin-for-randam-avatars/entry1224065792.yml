    \ It's just what I was looking for, but I was wondering if there any way to assign\
    \ a different image class and have two seperate instances of the ravatars so I\
    \ can control them independantly..\r\n\r\nOn my blog I have smaller sized ravatars\
    \ showing up with the recent comments on front page, but whatever changes I make\
    \ to the img.ravatar affects the ravatars on single post comment loop too and\
    \ they go all whacky sort of thing. It's on a local server at the moment, but\
    \ Im hoping to upload it later.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks, this plugin rocks.\r\n\r\n\
