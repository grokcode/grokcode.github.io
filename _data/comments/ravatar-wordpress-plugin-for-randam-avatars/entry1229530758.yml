    be a fragment of a file in the parts folder. I can see mystery man icon and another
    oil painting fragment representing 2 users in the USERS area. So the only place
    ravatars aren''t showing up anymore is in the comment itself! This is a great
    plugin, I really hope you can help me to use it - and I will donate! Thanks. W',
