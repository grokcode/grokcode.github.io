He broke his leg early in Sunday's 22-20 win over the Oakland Raiders, forcing the Bears to juggle an already short-handed line.\r\nThe Bears announced the hiring Monday.\r\nThe Vikings made the announcement on Thursday night before the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority holds a meeting on Friday. They say the extra money will go to enhancements in the plaza, food service equipment, entertainment areas in the stadium, upgrades to retractable seating and a deck that will overlook downtown Minneapolis.\r\nHouston has also grown into <a href=http://www.cheapnfljerseysclub.us.com/>Cheap Jerseys Online</a> one of the leaders in the locker room, helping keep things together when a rash of injuries struck last season. Despite losing linebacker Derrick Johnson and tackle Mike DeVito in the opener, the Chiefs still had one of the AFC's top defenses.\r\nCOUSINS IN CONTROL"
