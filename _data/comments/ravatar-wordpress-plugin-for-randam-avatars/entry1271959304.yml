    \ what area of the full images in parts are sampled? I would like to (in photoshop)\
    \ predetermine the size of the images - make them consistent.\"\r\nI finally got\
    \ the plugin working and made up an icon set in Photoshop with a grid of 80px\
    \ - 5 rows of 5 - and uploaded this thinking perhaps this would assign each user\
    \ an icon instead of part of an image. Nope. It just got random parts of the image,\
    \ instead of picking up an icon, say, 160px over and 240px down.\r\nThis is a\
    \ really great plugin and there's nothing else like it. (Believe me I've looked.)\
    \ Would be great to somehow get it to work the same as the generated identicons.",
