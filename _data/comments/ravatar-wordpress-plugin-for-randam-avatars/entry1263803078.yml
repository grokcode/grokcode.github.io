    \ though - how is the ravatar randomly assigned to the email addresses?  I have\
    \ uploaded 34 files, but I only have 28 users right now - but some ravatars are\
    \ getting assigned twice.  Is there a formula to the assignment of pictures? \
    \ I'd like the images not to repeat until all original 34 are used, if possible.\r\
    \n\r\nAlso, after I added a few more ravatars to the parts folder, the ravatar\
    \ assigned to admin posts changed, but the one assigned to my admin comments stayed\
    \ the same (if you look at my site - I used to have the guy on the motorcycle\
    \ on all my posts, and he's still there in my comments, but now my posts show\
    \ my picture of oranges).  I haven't changed my email address on the admin account,\
    \ so why would the avatar have changed (and why did it stay the same in the comments)?\
    \  Just curious!\r\n\r\nAgain, love this plugin, great job.", name: Katie, parent: 0,
