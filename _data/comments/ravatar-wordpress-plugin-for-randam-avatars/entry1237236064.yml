    \ I'm struggling to get it working on the <a href=\"http://ninjakiwi.com/blog\"\
    \ rel=\"nofollow\">Ninja Kiwi free games</a> blog I have been working on. \r\n\
    \r\nAs wwwindi reports I see ravatars in admin but not in comments on live site\
    \ - I'm using the Gravatar option and Ravatar as backup - have tried a bunch of\
    \ stuff and worked through all the comments above. Nothing sticks yet.\r\n\r\n\
