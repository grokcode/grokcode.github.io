    \ but its possible I missed something.  I would like to try to rule out the possibility\
    \ that it is either .htaccess or a WP Super Cache conflict.  Can you try this\
    \ test?\r\n\r\n1. Deactivate the WP Super Cache plugin\r\n2. Verify that everything\
    \ between '# BEGIN WPSuperCache' and '# END WPSuperCache' in .htaccess has been\
    \ removed\r\n3.  Comment out part of .htaccess by putting a '#' in front of each\
    \ of these lines and save the file  \r\n<blockquote>RewriteEngine On\r\nRewriteBase\
    \ /\r\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/(stats|failed_auth\\.html)/?(.*)$ [NC]\r\n\
    RewriteRule ^.*$ - [L] </blockquote>\r\n4. Make sure the Ravatars plugin is activated,\
    \ and your browser cache is cleared.  Do the ravatars show up?\r\n5. Remove the\
    \ #'s you added in step 2 and save the file.  Reactive WP Super Cache.\r\n\r\n\
    Note that this test will remove caching and stat tracking on your site for a short\
    \ period of time.  Get a backup of your original .htaccess before you start.",
