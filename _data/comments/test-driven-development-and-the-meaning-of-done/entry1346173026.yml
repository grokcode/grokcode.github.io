    \ a significant defect (i.e. one that must be fixed) that is found by QA delay\
    \ the ability to ship product? The cost of managing each defect also incurs incremental\
    \ delays that do add up.\r\n\r\nMore studies would be useful here, but \"faster\
    \ to develop\" isn't the only relevant factor. What is the cost of a defect? It's\
    \ not simply the time to fix it. Part of the cost gets shifted to the customer\
    \ in the form of wasted time or inability to effectively complete work, part of\
    \ it to your company in the form of support calls. When a defect is significant\
    \ enough, or when you have gobs of them, you lose customers (seen it). You also\
    \ lose opportunity time while you fix it, and the cost to fix will often increase\
    \ as the time between introduction and discovery increases.\r\n\r\nOther studies\
    \ might examine TDD (practiced with high levels of effort to incrementally keep\
    \ the code clean) and corresponding codebases over time. Most codebases are not\
    \ factored well and contain 50-100% more code than they need (this is anecdotal\
    \ but based off seeing hundreds of customer systems). \r\n\r\nWhat is the long-term\
    \ cost of a code base that is difficult to understand and maintain? How many of\
    \ us have spent an afternoon deciphering and struggling with adding a small feature\
    \ that should have taken only 15 minutes?\r\n\r\nIf I did TDD only to minimize\
    \ defects, I'd probably worry about the research and numbers more. But I'd also\
    \ insist on a proper accounting for the true cost of defects.", name: Jeff L.,
