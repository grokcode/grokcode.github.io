    \ code that's likely to be crappy. That's a calculated risk. The agile folks make\
    \ the case for a different tradeoff--shipping a smaller feature set of high quality,\
    \ then incrementing the product. Both can work; depends on the context.\r\n\r\n\
    I'd done enough of both TDD and not TDD. It usually only takes me a couple days\
    \ before I start recognizing time I'm wasting because I'm *not* doing TDD. If\
    \ my spaceship was the only hope, TDD would start paying off a day or two in.\
    \ I'd rather have a tool that prevented me from incorporating a major defect that\
    \ would cause it to crash and burn before I smugly sent it up at the last minute.\r\
    \n\r\nContrived examples aside, I've also seen shops that hacked together quite\
    \ solutions and shipped them to some success. Years later, every developer cursed\
    \ every minute of working on the software, now several hundred thousand lines\
    \ built atop a core hack-base of maybe 50,000 lines of really shitty code.\r\n\
    \r\nLack of quality costs far more in the long run.", name: Jeff L., parent: 67100,
