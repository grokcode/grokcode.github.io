    point it out. TDD isn''t the only effective defect reduction mechanism in town.  In
    fact, it''s not even considered to be the most effective. Individual developer
    and team design and code reviews are usually far more effective at identifying
    defects than TDD alone.  Especially for non-trivial systems. Should those non-TDD
    teams have been doing design and code reviews rather than TDD, they probably would
    have released higher-quality software, and they would have done so more quickly.
    Only practicing high-yield design and code reviews made using regularly updated
    checklists of common defects will convince you of this though. I''ve seen it work
    wonders in my own code and in my organization though.', name: Eric, parent: 0,
