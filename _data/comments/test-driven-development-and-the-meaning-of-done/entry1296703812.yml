    want to call any project of mine "done" unless it was feature complete and free
    of defects. However, I can imagine a few scenarios where it might be better to
    ship a buggy feature than not to ship it at all. A startup that wants a first
    mover advantage might fit into this category. Or to take your analogy a bit further,
    what if your spaceship was the only hope to destroy a comet on course to demolish
    the earth in a week?', name: Jess Johnson, parent: 56210, post_ID: 439, subscribe: N,
