    the bugs. Not all bugs even matter. Spending so much time testing can be even
    more wasteful than not. If the time taken to write and maintain unit tests is
    greater than the cost of just fixing the bug, then you are wasting time and resources.
    Now you have to bug fix your regular code and you have to bug fix your test code
    too. If you can''t write regular code properly, what makes you think you will
    write test code properly? Don''t you then need a unit test for the test code?',
