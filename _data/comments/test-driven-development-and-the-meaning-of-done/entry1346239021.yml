    \ and personal experience as justification, that giving the non-TDD teams more\
    \ time will help much less than you'd expect, primarily because the people on\
    \ those teams spend the extra time thinking about algorithms and data structures,\
    \ rather than thinking about interfaces and behavior.\r\n\r\nIn other words, simply\
    \ giving the non-TDD teams more time will not encourage them to think about the\
    \ kinds of things that lead to asking \"Have we done everything we need to do\
    \ yet?\" TDD provides but one mechanism to encourage people to ask this question\
    \ -- indeed, it encourages people to make a habit out of asking this question.",
