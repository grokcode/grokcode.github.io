    \ section contains that graph and the conclusion that comfortable or slightly\
    \ cooler than comfort are best for productivity, but they didn't do a good job\
    \ of explaining how they define the comfort zone.\r\n\r\nI think part of the problem\
    \ is that the temperature comfort zone will change depending on the season, the\
    \ location, and from person to person. Right now I have the AC set at 28\xB0C/82\xB0\
    F, which according to the graph is very unproductive. However, it's 35\xB0C/95\xB0\
    F outside and my office feels plenty cool to me.", name: Jess Johnson, parent: 70308,
