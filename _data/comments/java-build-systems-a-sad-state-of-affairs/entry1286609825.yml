    but not all.  Maven 3 is just released and has solved many problems of its predecessors.  Outside
    of maven''s scope of control though is this concept of a global dependency tree.  Over
    this past decade, open source projects have been transformed.  No longer is it
    simply to build a stand-alone component.  Projects have dependencies on other
    public projects.  The job of tracking dependencies is complex and needs to be
    segmented.  Identifiying a project''s dependencies belongs to the projects producer,
    not consumer.  Component producers must be brought to task for weak dependency
    definitions.  Any dependency resolution tool suffers from the fault of the component
    producers who neglect their own dependency tree.', name: john, parent: 0, post_ID: 538,
