    not suitable for building Java code (at least when using <code>javac</code>) was
    due to the <code>javac behavior of pulling dependencies into the compilation stage
    if they were needed to correctly build a class file, thus making some dependencies
    implicit, which <code>make</code> is rather bad at dealing with. See http://www.fudco.com/software/jdep.html
