    \ these days. Then, every time you hit something hard to do in ant's xml, drop\
    \ into JS and code away in that. You get full access to all the ant tasks, targets\
    \ and variables, plus you can set your own properties to be used by java when\
    \ you're done. It's so much easier than the old way of using custom tasks and\
