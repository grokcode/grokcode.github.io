    \ developers of Gradle at the Java One convention.... undoubtedly this was a highlight\
    \ of the whole convention, these gents had such vigor and spark that it made me\
    \ WANT to use Gradle... as a result I have had members of my team review it....\
    \ and... all the feedback has been positive... notably... much of the criticism\
    \ highlighted in the article is addressed by the Gradle solution... In any event...\
