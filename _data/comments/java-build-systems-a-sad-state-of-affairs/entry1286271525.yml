    \ and there's no money. Even as you expressed the issues, which I completely agree\
    \ with, you didn't offer a good alternative. And I don't blame you, it's hard.\
    \ Many people have ideas on how to solve some specific aspects, but to overhaul\
    \ it is a big task, and it too will probably encounter other issues.\r\n\r\nAnd\
    \ again, above it being a hard problem to solve, there's hardly any money into\
    \ it. How many people and companies would pay for a good build solution? Most\
    \ will still continue to force their developers to use ant/maven, even in the\
    \ face of better solutions. It's really hard to compete with free solutions that\
    \ are pretty ingrained. It's much like version control solutions, it's a hard\
    \ market to compete in, probably much harder since it's not something you modify\
    \ or use daily (by this I mean edit, modify, etc., not call a build file such\
    \ as in daily builds).", name: Steph, parent: 0, post_ID: 538, subscribe: N, url: 'http://www.FollowSteph.com'}
