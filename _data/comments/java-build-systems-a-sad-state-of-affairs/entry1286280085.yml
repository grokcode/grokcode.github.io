    \ there was no documentation.  It looks like a wrapper around AntBuilder.  I've\
    \ noticed that Gant is bundled with some distributions of Groovy.\r\n\r\nAnt is\
    \ adequate for building binaries.  What I really need is a better way of starting\
    \ and stopping servers and cleaning deployment directories.  With Ant it is difficult\
    \ to do things like \r\n\r\n    check if a server is running\r\n    Start it if\
    \ it is not running\r\n    Shut down the server if it is running\r\n    Wait until\
    \ the server is stopped to clean the deploy directories\r\n\r\nAnything requiring\
    \ if ... else logic is awkward in Ant.\r\n\r\nGroovy with AntBuilder should give\
    \ me what I need for these basic tasks.", name: Dean Schulze, parent: 0, post_ID: 538,
