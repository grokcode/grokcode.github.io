    problem. I''ve made my living running a small consultancy for 4 years helping
    people with software development tools. I''d say less than 20% of that time has
    been spent with version control systems and builds. Most of my work has been customizing
    Atlassian tools such as <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" rel="nofollow">JIRA</a>,
    which are used by a larger number of groups within most organizations so get more
    dollars spent on them.  Builds tools are very specialized and don''t get the money
    they really should, in my opinion.', name: Matt Doar, parent: 0, post_ID: 538,
