  karma: 0, message: 'I chose Gradle as well over Maven and the others. Someone mentioned
    poor docs for Gradle which is baffling to me. Gradle has very good docs. Gradle
    has the obvious benefit of Groovy, Ivy based dependency management, and full access
    to Ant tasks and extensions for backward compatibility. Another big win is project
    dependencies where you can specify dependencies to other projects on the file
    system. If you make a change in one project and compile the other, everything
    will be compiled as needed. Maven is a nightmare if you have multiple projects
    that are being actively developed together.', name: Bryan, parent: 0, post_ID: 538,
