    pattern.  To me this was Ant largest failing.  Over the years each place I worked
    with ant had their own convention for how ant projects built, but each was complex
    and unique.  For all of mavens failings the convention aspect is well enforced,
    and I''ve never seen a maven project that was horribly complex.  My concern with
    using a touring complete language in a build env is that it opens itself up to
    making more company specific plaforms..ie back to ant land.', name: chris, parent: 0,
