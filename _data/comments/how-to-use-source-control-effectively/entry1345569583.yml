    feature branching.  At the minimum make a branch at every production release.  If
    you are working on a feature with a lot of breaking changes, then consider a feature
    branch which allows you more control over what code gets pushed into your main
    branch.  Don''t branch unecessarily, it is extra work.', name: Harry, parent: 0,
