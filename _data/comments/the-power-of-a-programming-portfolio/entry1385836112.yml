    \ for my portfolio, which I am starting.  I know that most of this conversation\
    \ is as old as fossils, but here are some thoughts.\r\n\r\n@Sourabh I've struggled\
    \ with the same thing.  Although I've been in this field for many years, the nature\
    \ of my previous jobs were such that I haven't worked on any \"big projects\"\
    \ or done anything that I considered *mine* or seemed especially impressive or\
    \ noteworthy.  I finally decided that I needed to have projects that are expressly\
    \ for my portfolio.  I'm finishing up my first one and am quite pleased with how\
    \ it turned out.  It might not be ideal to write to a portfolio, if you will,\
    \ but I think it's a place to start.\r\n\r\n@Robby, I've been in situations where\
    \ I've had the knowledge, but haven't been offered the job because my experience\
    \ is a little thin.  I spent 7 years documenting a technology.  I think I know\
    \ it inside and out, but the lack of concrete work has made transitioning to a\
    \ straight development job more difficult.  So it goes both ways.  Employers want\
    \ the knowledge AND the evidence.", name: Carole, parent: 0, post_ID: 58, subscribe: Y,
