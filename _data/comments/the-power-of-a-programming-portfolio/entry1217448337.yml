    \r\n<blockquote cite=\"http://www.robbyslaughter.com/consulting/portfolio/\">It\
    \ seems like a portfolio of technical work should be like a private art gallery:\
    \ the ultimate display of skill. But really, it's more like a picture of a field\
    \ of icebergs. Almost of all of the important details are hidden below the surface,\
    \ and who knows how much things have changed since the photo was taken. A portfolio\
    \ implies a history of work, but is not proof of expertise.\"</blockquote>\r\n\
