  karma: 0, message: '"willCode4Beer" hit the nail on the head. Having spent the majority
    of my own career as a consultant, every consulting company and client whose environment
    I worked in (creating my innovative solutions to resolve their business problems)
    all considered my work to be "client confidential and proprietary". Consulting
    company employees sign non-disclosure, non-compete, proprietary intellectual property
    confidentiality agreements all the time. Better check with an attorney first or
    you may find your own portfolio as prosecution evidence being used against you
    in a court of law. Remember also that anything created with client resources (time
    and/or equipment) is normally their copyrighted property and would require written
    permission to be presented in a portfolio. I do have some   FAC bar napkins documenting
    some of my successful design solutions ... only natural since free thinking thrives
