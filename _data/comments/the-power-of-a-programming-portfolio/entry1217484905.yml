    Past may be prologue, but what you can do is still more important than what you\
    \ have done. Challenging projects need leaders who are both experienced and expert.\
    \ The best way to find out if someone is qualified is to ask them tough questions,\
    \ have them actively demonstrate real understanding, and see if you are immediately\
    \ impressed by the results.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe best proof of expertise\
    \ is demonstration. As has been pointed out by many people, 99% of applicants\
    \ for programming jobs <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000781.html\"\
    \ rel=\"nofollow\">can't actually program</a> and fail simple interview tests\
    \ like \"write a program that prints all the odd numbers between one and a hundred\"\
    .\r\n\r\nPortfolios can be a useful source of talking points for an interview\
    \ and sometimes clients or employeers will review portfolios to assist in their\
    \ decisions. It's something everyone should consider, but it's not nearly as important\
    \ as actually knowing and demonstrating your stuff. Like when <a href=\"http://weblog.raganwald.com/2006/07/hiring-juggler_02.html\"\
    \ rel=\"nofollow\">hiring a juggler</a>, always ask candidates to code in interviews,\
    \ and never take a job where they don't care to see you write code.", name: Robby
