    \ for bringing it up in the comments.     \r\n\r\n@fluminis Great images on your\
    \ portfolio!  They really make the portfolio interesting.  Have you thought about\
    \ bringing printed copies to an interview?\r\n\r\n@Robby True that a portfolio\
    \ isn't proof of expertise, but really what is?  A resume shows even less proof\
    \ of expertise, and it can be hard to show expertise in an interview if you are\
    \ flustered or just don't interview well.  I guess I like the portfolio approach\
    \ because say I am the only developer on a project, an interviewer would be able\
    \ to tell pretty quickly with some basic questions about the project if I really\
    \ did the work or not.  I suppose this is more true of application developers\
    \ than of web developers & designers though.\r\n\r\n@Edward I like how your portfolio\
    \ is searchable by platform and technology.  It makes it really easy to find relevant\
    \ experience when there are a lot of projects. \r\n\r\n@Daniel Sure go ahead and\
    \ copy the format!", name: Jess Johnson, parent: 0, post_ID: 58, subscribe: N,
