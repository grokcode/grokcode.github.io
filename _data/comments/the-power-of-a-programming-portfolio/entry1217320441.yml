    \ to put together a portfolio. Most companies require employees to sign NDA's.\
    \ This means putting your best work into a portfolio could leave you open to legal\
    \ action.\r\n\r\nAn alternative is participation in open source projects. But,\
    \ if you are working on an open source project, it doesn't need to be in a portfolio.\
    \ It can stand alone.\r\n\r\nI'm not against having a portfolio, in fact, I think\
    \ it's a great idea. Just be sure to understand the issues that can prevent people\
    \ from having one. I often recommend that developers have their own web site.\
    \ They can post code from personal projects and answers to problems they've faced.\
    \ It can serve as both an online notebook (that's what mine is) and a portfolio\
    \ at the same time.\r\n\r\nI've been in interviews where at the end we are just\
    \ talking and discover that the interviewer had actually found solutions to their\
    \ problems from my website. Now, that's a big ego booster.", name: willCode4Beer,
