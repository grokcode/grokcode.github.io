  Hello, I am new to blogging and internet sites in general and was wanting to
  know how you got the "www" included in your domain name? I see your domain,
  "%BLOGURL%" has the www and my domain looks like, "http://mydomain.com". Do
  you know just how I can alter this? I'm using Wordpress. Regards
