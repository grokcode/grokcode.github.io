message: "Songwriter s Keidran Jones, Jonathan White, Mark Anthony Joseph Morrison, Jonathan Rotem, Willie Maxwell, Dijon Shariff Thames, Daniel Stephenson, Calvin Broadus.\r\nTHAT S WHAT YOU CALL PERCEPTION.\r\nBut if you take only that classic mid-Seventies period for both bands, there s hardly any doubt that the Dolls were not only far closer to the Stones in spirit, but also far more tasteful - and moderately more talented - than Aerosmith.\r\n   http://gravelmoondonndorintrius.info/lossless/made-in-england-elton-john-tantrums-tiaras-laserdisc.php   Not just the density of the sound, which is itself astonishing, but the baffling, jaw-dropping, pulse-quickening juxtaposition of chaos and coherence across the whole album.\r\nOver and over I read that this was an unexpected surprise, and the one album that no one on the ground recommends or mentions.\r\nBATMAN Yo nunca asesinaba yo era el Batman A todos tГє salvabas por quГ© no aquГ­."
