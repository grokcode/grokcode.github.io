  First off I want to say superb blog! I had a quick question which I'd like to
  ask if you don't mind. I was interested to find out how you center yourself
  and clear your thoughts prior to writing. I've had a difficult time clearing
  my thoughts in getting my thoughts out there. I truly do take pleasure in
  writing but it just seems like the first 10 to 15 minutes are wasted simply
  just trying to figure out how to begin. Any suggestions or tips? Thank you!
