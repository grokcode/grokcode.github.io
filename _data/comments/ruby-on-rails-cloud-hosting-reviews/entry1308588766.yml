    (not sure about Winnie Cloud), so they are all vulnerable to AWS outages. As of
    the last big AWS outage, Engine Yard was the only one to have a multi-region failover
    strategy. I don''t have enough experience to make general comments about the reliability
    of the various platforms, but Engine Yard is better setup to weather problems
    with the underlying AWS platform.', name: Jess Johnson, parent: 70409, post_ID: 709,
