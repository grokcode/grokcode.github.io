    \ in the document root; it shouldn't be possible for the web server to serve the\
    \ python files. In the config above, nginx only serves files in the /var/www/app-name/static\
    \ directory, so in this case, even though the django project lives in /var/www/app-name/project,\
    \ I think it still follows that guideline in spirit. There isn't any increased\
    \ risk here since nginx doesn't have access to the .py files.\r\n\r\nGreat question!",
