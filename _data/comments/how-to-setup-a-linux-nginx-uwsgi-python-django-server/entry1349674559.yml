  karma: 0, message: just one more thing to point out that there was no file named
    default.conf in location /etc/nginx/conf.d. So what I did was moved the files
    in location /etc/nginx/sites-avalaible which had name default and another location
    /etc/nginx/sites-enabled with the same name default to default.back and then I
    restarted nginx but I still got the same 404 error page, name: saad, parent: 70679,
