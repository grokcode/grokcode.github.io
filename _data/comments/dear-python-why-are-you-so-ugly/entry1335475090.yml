    \n1 - That Python interfaces aren't as well designed as Ruby interfaces\r\n2 -\
    \ This has an affect on the number of people who are willing to pay to build stuff\
    \ in Python and on the number of people who learn Python.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure\
    \ if you are disagreeing with #1 by saying that design is subjective, or if you\
    \ are saying that it isn't really worth talking about why Python sites are less\
    \ attractive, despite the fact that figuring that out could provide some solutions\
    \ to #2.\r\n\r\nFirst, design is very subjective if we are only talking about\
    \ \"making stuff pretty\", but stuff like UX/UI design can be done objectively\
    \ by doing user studies and measuring stuff like bounce rates or conversion rates.\
    \ One design is objectively better than another if a visitor can more easily find\
    \ the information they need. I don't have access to any of the stats for the sites\
    \ I mentioned in the article, so the only kind of comparisons I can make are more\
    \ gut feeling ones. For me, stuff built using Ruby tends to be easier and more\
    \ pleasant to use than stuff built using Python. That is a subjective statement,\
    \ but I still think it's worthwhile to talk about (especially when coming from\
    \ a Python developer).\r\n\r\nI also think it is worthwhile to speculate why this\
    \ is the case, because coming up with some ideas could lead to solutions for improving\
    \ the UI of stuff written in Python. That would be a good thing for the Python\
