    \ of good design is fundamentally related to the Python programming language itself.\r\
    \n\r\nI don't mean to imply that there is something about the Python language\
    \ that causes bad frontend design. This is not the case. However, there must be\
    \ something about the Python community that is contributing to this problem. Maybe\
    \ we don't value good design, or maybe we don't know how to connect with good\
    \ designers and UX/UI people.\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt; As to your first point, perhaps\
    \ I am not understanding exactly what interfaces you are referring to...\r\n\r\
    \nI apologize for not being clear. When I say \"interface\" here I am talking\
    \ about the user interface. So the \"design\" or \"front end\", not the programming\
    \ interface.\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt; I am not saying its not worth discussing why the\
    \ number of python sites are seemingly more poorly designed, only that the discussion\
    \ is better framed around teaching/encouraging good design principles.\r\n\r\n\
    Thanks for calling this out - the framing of the article should have been better.\
    \ Pointing out examples of (subjectively) good and bad design will perhaps help\
    \ get people to acknowledge the problem, but it doesn't make any progress toward\
    \ actually fixing it. If I was a designer I might feel more comfortable about\
    \ recommending specific design principles, but referring people to some expert\
    \ sources (the books by Jarrod Drysdale, Sacha Greif, and David Kadavy) is at\
    \ least a step in the right direction.", name: Jess Johnson, parent: 70566, post_ID: 746,
