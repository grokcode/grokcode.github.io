  karma: 0, message: 'I respectfully disagree. As a python developer I take exception
    to the idea that poorly designed front ends are in any way connected to the back
    end language. Web design and development are comprised of two distinct areas the
    back end and front end. The back end, regardless of language, takes input, process
    that input and/or retrieves data, and pushes it back to the front end via a template
    of one form or another. The front end is then responsible for the layout and style
    thereby creating the user experience via HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The point
    is that while I would agree many sites based on python are not that attractive
    its a reflection of the developers background and intent, not the server side
    language they used.', name: ntlarson, parent: 0, post_ID: 746, subscribe: Y, url: ''}
