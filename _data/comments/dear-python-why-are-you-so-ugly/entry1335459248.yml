    \ documentation with the top page of the Rails documentation.  Have you looked\
    \ at what it takes to actually find the information &amp; documentation you want?\
    \   For example, let me show you:\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.python.org/\r\n\r\nvs.\r\n\
    \r\nhttp://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/\r\n\r\nRuby's use of frames (yes, old-school\
    \ HTML frames) is totally unacceptable.  Google results pop you down into a place\
    \ where you can't navigate back up again.  Python is fully and well documented.\
    \  Let's compare Rails vs. Django\r\n\r\nDjango Forms: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/?from=olddocs\r\
    \nRails FormHelper: http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper.html\r\
    \n\r\nPlease.  It's comical how ugly and poorly documented Rails is.", name: Steve
