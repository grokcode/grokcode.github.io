    \ RoR's website makes you feel excited...\r\n\r\nOne thing that Python really\
    \ has going for it is Sphinx. Is there an equivalent for Ruby documentation? \
    \ Quick web search reveals yard and RDoc, but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nWhile coding,\
    \ it's great to be able to be able to look up information on functions from the\
    \ command line (with pydoc or help).", name: George, parent: 70563, post_ID: 746,
