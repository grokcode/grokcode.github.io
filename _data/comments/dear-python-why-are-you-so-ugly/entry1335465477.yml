    as the number of people developing the sites. It could be simple lack of resources,
    it could be lack of experience, or simply the fact that getting the end result
    out was more important than the design... or in other terms, focus on content
    and usability (to mean everything technically works and people can get to the
    data without waiting for a designer to skin the site) overruled flash and sexiness.
    Maybe its a matter of taste, maybe they like the old school square column/sidebar
    layout, it could be the background of the user base (python is more science/sys
    admin based users vs Ruby''s more artsy user base) is showing through.... who
    knows, we could speculate for hours. The point is, the question is a subjective
    one, not an objective one. Without a technical tie in to the language, there is
    no objective answer to the question.', name: ntlarson, parent: 70560, post_ID: 746,
