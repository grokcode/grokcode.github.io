    \ rails is more commonly used in web environments. Ruby has a nice fast math notation\
    \ part in it, and its more a follow up to people who used Perl and want a real\
    \ programing language instead.\r\n\r\nHowever python is much older and has a different\
    \ origin. Its not a main web language (although web services can use python).\
    \ Since however its not mainly used by web people dont suspect great web pages.\
    \ Rather with python think of command line things, think of easy interaction with\
    \ openCV, or think of easy integration with scientific modules.\r\nFor starters\
    \ dough there is a great forum to start with python where newbies and advanced\
    \ programmers are very active.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.python-forum.org/pythonforum/index.php\r\
    \n\r\nnot as great looking but great content for any newbie", name: Peter, parent: 0,
