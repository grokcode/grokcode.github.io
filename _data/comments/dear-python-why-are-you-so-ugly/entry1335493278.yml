    \ the languages. Anecdotally, at least, nearly all the designers/UX people I know\
    \ who've decided to learn the development side of things have gone to Railsbridge\
    \ workshops (or similar) and learned Rails. I don't know how or when it started,\
    \ but there's a lot of overlap between the design and Rails communities and that\
    \ commonality perpetuates itself. (Birds of a feather flock together and all that.)\r\
    \n\r\nWhereas most Pythonistas it seems started out as coders and stuck with it.\
    \ (Plus the science majors who were introduced via scipy et al.) I'm one of the\
    \ weirdo designers who happened to fall in love with Python later in life and\
    \ who doesn't really get Ruby; we exist, but it's kinda lonely over here. And\
    \ resource-wise, honestly, when one of my designer friends tells me that they\
    \ want to learn web programming and don't know where to start, it's hard for me\
    \ to not wistfully point them to Railsbridge et al. The resources and the attitude\
    \ for newcomers and designers are already there, where they aren't as much in\
    \ most Python groups. I'm working on changing this, but it's slow.\r\n\r\ntldr;\
    \ It's not (just) a matter of knowing to hire a designer or not, it's whether\
    \ you're actively recruiting designers to code with you and join your community.",
