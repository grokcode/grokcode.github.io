    \ end design, as I explained above, has nothing to do with the back end mechanics.\
    \ Even considering frameworks with different tools to generate the front end html,\
    \ that is as far as the back end interacts with the front end. Once the HTML is\
    \ generated, either boilerplate or via a template system, the design, the look,\
    \ feel, and usability of the site is based on CSS and JS (possibly some 3rd party\
    \ tech like Flash if you are developing for older browser tech). To link the two\
    \ is as silly as saying the engine in a Gremlin is responsible for its ugliness.\
    \ \r\n\r\nI have been looking more at things relating to graphic design and my\
    \ stance on this has only been strengthened after pointedly spending time educating\
    \ myself further in the principles of graphic design. \r\n\r\nThe only thing limiting\
    \ Python sites aesthetics are the developers themselves. As Jess and I discussed\
    \ above, the lack of better design does have an impact on the overall perception\
    \ of the community, and this is unfortunate. However, there is no legitimate connection\
    \ to the majority of pages backed by python being ugly, and the python language\
    \ itself. What needs to be addressed is a better exposure of design principles\
    \ to the developers, not merely working in a different language or framework.\
    \ Ruby or java or .NET offer nothing of direct significance that will make the\
    \ site inherently more attractive. \r\n\r\nOn a side note. I have purchased the\
    \ Design For Hackers book Jess recommended as well as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Graphic-Design-Second-Edition/dp/1581157622/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336076355&amp;sr=8-2\"\
    \ rel=\"nofollow\">The Elements of Graphic Design</a> I am about a quarter of\
    \ the way through this one. I also purchased a few books on typography as this\
    \ is a critical part of good design for the web. So far they all look good, though\
    \ I have not read them all yet, only so much time in a day :-)", name: ntlarson,
