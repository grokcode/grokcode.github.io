message: "Plus two games each against the NFC North, the Vikings will play the NFC West and AFC West: at Arizona, San Francisco, Denver and <a href=http://www.cheapshoeswholesale.us.com/>Cheap Shoes Website</a> Oakland and home against St. Louis, Seattle, Kansas City and San Diego. By finishing third, the Vikings will also host the New York Giants and play at Atlanta.\r\nCoach Bruce Arians begs to differ.\r\nIf the offensive line was better, would a 2,000-yard season be possible?\r\n\"No one thought about panicking and we were able to get it done,\" said Rivers, who signed an $84 million contract extension during training camp.  \"We <a href=http://www.saleshoesshop.com/>Wholesale Shoes China Free Shipping</a> couldn't be much worse in that first half. We just couldn't get going and when we did we threw it to them,\" Rivers said.\r\nSo opponents must again stay on their toes against a quarterback known for his ability to extend plays."
