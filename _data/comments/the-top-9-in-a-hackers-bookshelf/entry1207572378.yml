    \ find the later editions of \"Unix power tools\" to be too perl-oriented, where\
    \ the earlier editions were much better. I'd add Eric Raymond's \"<a href=\"http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/\"\
    \ rel=\"nofollow\">The art of Unix programming</a>\". ESR may have lost his marbles\
    \ at times, but in that book, he manages to pretty accurately capture the philosophy\
    \ that drives the Unix culture[1]. Even if you're not coding on Unix, the approaches\
    \ laid out in the book should make you a better coder.\r\n\r\n[1] Although in\
    \ places, he tries to force tools into that culture that really don't fit, such\
    \ as Emacs -- I'd have preferred it if he'd just said \"Emacs isn't a good fit\
    \ with the Unix culture, but many hackers use it because it's useful\".", name: Tet,
