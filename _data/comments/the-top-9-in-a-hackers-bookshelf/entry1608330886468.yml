message: "The coronavirus pandemic has unnatural universities to switch to interval learning. essay review service free <a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>college thesis</a> lchs community service essay. \r\nBut what is happening nowadays can be called an special delivery of content to audience members in isolation . A lot of colleges  and the teachers themselves were not prepared for the teach online. According to a 2019 HSE study, University educators with an academic degree rate their level of proficiency in remote technologies at 3.2 points out of five. One in four people has never utilized remote video services get  in webinars or video conferences in the past three years. \r\nBut professors are not required to own online studying technologies. They were simply not ready for this, although education and its new methods are the main function of colleges. Try to oblige the surgeon to do their work from home. Let him explain to the patient via Skype how to remove his appendicitis. It sounds crazy. Therefore, the resourcefulness with which teachers adapt to the remote format is commendable. \r\n \r\nSometimes it is funny. Colleagues from regional universities told that some teachers asked to write conspectuses by hand and send them scans for according.Nowadays, people communicate remotely in real time thanks to digital technologies, students can \"raise their hands\" with a single button, they can write with a finger on a tablet as on a blackboard, and they are told: \"Please write a handwritten summary and send the scan.\" Or, for example, this case: a physical education teacher asked students to shoot five-minute videos where they perform physical exercises. Although remote physical education training can be more original, for example, you can make a selection of ready-made videos on YouTube, find checklists in the popular domain, and teach them to play sports online, while you can't go anywhere anywhere. \r\n \r\nUniversity educators are faced with a lack of guidance and difficulties in dealing with organizational matters. Someone conduct lessons on Skype, someone -in Zoom, some of them only sends questions to WhatsApp. Some teachers record lessons on a webcam and send them to students. The quality of such materials is very low, and it is quite difficult  to perceive them. At least because the content on YouTube, which students are used to, is shot and edited professionally and the viewer is spoiled by the quality of video materials. \r\nThere are also problems with monitoring attendance. Some teachers ask you to put a \" + \" in the chat, others require  you to turn on Webcams and take screenshots of students. Against the background of all the misunderstandings and difficulties, one element of academic life remains unchanged - assessment. Students don't study on campus, but they will get grades, even formal ones. \r\n<a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>honours thesis</a> \r\nOnline learning  does not have these disadvantages, because it is based on a carefully designed learning process in an electronic information and educational environment. Educators have instructions, manuals, memos,checklists, templates for emails and notifications, and even presentations. Everything is thought out here-from the screen saver before the lesson to the slide with homework."
