message: "Defensive end Howard Jones' 43-yard fumble return for a touchdown put the visitors ahead 24-0 in the second quarter.\r\nWhile seeing offensive linemen struggle early in camp certainly isn't ideal for the Dolphins, there might be a greater good.\r\nCarr's only 300-yard passing game before last week came last season in Cleveland. But that performance was far less efficient than the one that beat the Ravens with Oakland's highest-scoring game since 2010.\r\nIt didn't get better in the first half for the hosts. Randall Cobb caught an 18-yard TD pass on the final play of the opening quarter to make it 13-0; Green Bay outgained Seattle 137-3 in the period.\r\nBEREA, Ohio (AP) é”Ÿ?The Browns found help at wide receiver. Brian Hartline is heading home."
