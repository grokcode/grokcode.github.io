    book on their lists. It makes me wonder if anyone has actually read the book,
    or just put in down because everyone else has it. The book deserves recognition
    because it seemed to kick off the patterns idea, but the book itself is not a
    great read: dense, pedantic and at the same time obtuse (although to be both pedantic
    and obtuse takes some skill). I found the Head First patterns book and Holub on
    Patterns to be much more understandable. I was never a fan of the Hitchhiker books,
    so I would have to replace it with another.', name: scott gardner, parent: 0,
