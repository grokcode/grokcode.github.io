    \ comment \"if they had only known sooner.\"\r\n\r\nThis isn't meant to stoke\
    \ any flames and there are of course many cases where Windows is necessary/desirable/preferred\
    \ and Unix/Linux would be worse.  I'm not arguing against any of these.  But if\
    \ you are a generally OS-agnostic career programmer, learning Unix/Linux will\
    \ likely pay you back many times over in the same vein as learning touch-typing\
    \ did.\r\n\r\nIf using Windows, at a minimum I would recommend installing and\
    \ spending at least some time learning Cygwin.  When I use a Windows workstation\
