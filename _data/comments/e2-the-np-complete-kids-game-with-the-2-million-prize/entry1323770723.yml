    where to send it.  Tomy(distributors) advised me to contact the maker via email
    and gave me an address I sent an email three times never got a response so I guess
    your out of luck....the winnings were meant to go to the closest entry after the
    final deadline but surprisingly nothing appeared in the papers etc so I'm guessing
    it didnt happen and they just kept the prize....sucks for those of us with a solution
