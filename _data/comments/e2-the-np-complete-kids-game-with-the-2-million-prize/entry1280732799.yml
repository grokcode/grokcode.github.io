    \ <b>2 hints</b> my current times for each corner piece are:\r\n\r\ncorner 1:\
    \ 108.546374 secs (2 solutions)\r\ncorner 2: time: 92.717353 secs (0 solutions)\r\
    \ncorner 3: time: 80.345329 secs (0 solutions)\r\ncorner 4: time: 101.156403 secs\
    \ (0 solutions)\r\n\r\nWith just one hint it took about 20 minutes or so to find\
    \ the first solution,\r\nand 1751.234429 secs to finish scanning the first corner.\r\
    \n\r\nUnrelatedly, I find it funny this is being discussed on a two year old blog\
