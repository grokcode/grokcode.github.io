    the grok 8x8 there are 24 edges but only 3 different colours, so on average 8
    possible candidates for first 3 edges, then 7 for the next 3.  For centre pieces
    where you already have 2 sides to match the expected number of candidates is 34
    (pieces left) x4 (rotation) /8^2 = 2.125, since there are 8 different colours
    on centre pieces, hence the 2^16 in my formula.  I threw together some code to
    do a recursive backtrack and that verified my numbers.  I think the answer is
    that the hint pieces reduce the number of nodes (by piece 25) from 400bn by a
    factor of 8^4, so to around 100m.  I found a paper that suggests most alogorithms
    handle around 4m nodes per second, so with the hints the run-time is OK.  But
    I still don''t understand how dPUNiSH3R can solve in 5 secs.  Implication is that
    there are some short cuts, which is what I''m interested in.', name: Chilly, parent: 0,
