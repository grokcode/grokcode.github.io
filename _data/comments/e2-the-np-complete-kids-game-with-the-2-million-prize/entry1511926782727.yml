message: "Hey Dean here, I was doing a scan of sites that are showing that ugly YOUR NOT SECURE Image. \r\n did you know? As of October 1, 2017, Google (as de facto bosses of the internet) have decided to fully implement the most dangerous warnings about unprotected sites.  \r\n Up to now, they've only been toying with us, like a cat fiddles with a mouse until he's ready to bite off its head and eat it whole BUT now they're going in for the kill! trust me you are losing clients. but I have a fix for you \r\n http://allhatsmedia.info \r\n thanks Dean"
