    code, very similar to what I tried myself first. But after that I saw that the
    quite complex optimization which worked well for C++ doesn''t help in Java. So
    my new Java code is more similar to the original code of Marc Lebel, which suprizingly
    is about 10% faster than the one to one port - and almost the same speed as the
    original C++ version. A further modification is to support finding maximal partial
    solutions - as far as I know there was a 10.000 prize for finding a 467 correct
    edges partial last year. I allow with some small probability the placement of
    not completely fitting pieces during the search in order to get some promizing
    piece placements with only a few nonfitting edges, and then try to optimize these
    by exchanging pieces. Some data structures needed to be adapted in order to support
    this.', name: Doc Smith, parent: 0, post_ID: 10, subscribe: N, url: ''}
