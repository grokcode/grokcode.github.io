    \ using the 2 hint pieces. (\"8\xD78 with 2 hints\" benchmark used here)\r\n\r\
    \nSummary of my results:\r\n\r\n2 hints:  starting with right corner then 5 seconds\
    \ to solve,  starting with a no solution corner then 120 seconds to detect no\
    \ solution.  http://img193.imageshack.us/img193/4313/grok8x82hints.jpg\r\n\r\n\
    If I use only 1 hint (the first hint):  starting with right corner then 16 minutes\
    \ to solve, bad corner then 164 minutes to detect no solution.\r\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/6752/grok8x81hint.jpg\r\
    \n\r\nI run my solver using 4 instances running in parallel (in a quad core),\
    \ each instance with a different corner piece fixed (4 possible), so I solve it\
    \ in 5 seconds with 2 hints, and 16 minutes with 1 hint.\r\n\r\nUse the same test\
    \ puzzle for a better comparison.", name: dPUNiSH3R, parent: 0, post_ID: 10, subscribe: Y,
