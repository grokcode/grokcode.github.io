    half shape is not perfectly cut, so when joined together they do not make  symettrical
    shapes, however there seems to be a father and mother piece which seems to make
    it a little easier when looking for a specific colour, for instance, The yellow
    circle with the purple cross is not symmetrical when two pieces put together,
    however you can discount all the larger pieces needed to complete the cross, or
    am I wrong and was just V. unlucky to have a badly cut board?', name: Kuyler,
