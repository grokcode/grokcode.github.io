  karma: 0, message: 'what country are you in...the 3rd and 4th clue puzzles were
    not released in New Zealand but I contacted the distributors of the first two
    puzzles here directly and bought the ''demo'' copies sent to them....and of course
    solved them....so I have 5 pieces towards one solution which is a good start....I
    have a level of understanding with regards to the possible combinations for this
    puzzle(astronomical) and no programming skills whatsoever and would love to just
    be ''lucky'' solving it the way any jigsaw is solved by putting the right pieces
    together but do not wish to have the big cardboard pieces to carry around everywhere
    and really want to put a simple programme on my laptop that can ''save'' pieces
    in set places and I could re-open to continue the puzzle ....it would also be
    nice if it could sort pieces so you can just se pieces that have a specific shape
    on them to save time but I have yet to find anything that does this....you would
    think Tomy would make an online site (even paid membership) or an electronic version
    what a marketing failure....and no it wouldnt have to contain solution code just
    let the person print thier finsihed product and buy the cardboard version and
    transfer the info.  If anyone can advise where I can get this I''m keen to buy
    one still got a month :-)', name: Angela, parent: 0, post_ID: 10, subscribe: Y,
