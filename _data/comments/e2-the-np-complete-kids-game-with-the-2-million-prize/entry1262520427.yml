    not next to the piece that they should match with. Symmetrical would not matter
    as long as the patterns match. All boards have some pieces that were cut a little
    bit off. Its nothing to worry about. Just dont look into the way they are cut
    too much as it does not mean anything.', name: David in Atlanta, parent: 0, post_ID: 10,
