    5 border types, 18 center types took... One have completed: 2 min 43 sec, but
    others may take  hours or days... not waiting those... 10x10 has only 100 pieces...
    16x16 has 256... and each increase 1-10 times the time needed for solving, so
    lots of improvement has to happen before Eternity 2 is solved.', name: P-E-X,
