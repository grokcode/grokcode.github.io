    \ I decided to write my own solver and thought I could share some benchmarks for\
    \ 5 border edge types, 17 interior edge types (like the original game):\r\n9x9\
    \ table - average time: 2.5 seconds\r\n10x10 table - average time: 155 seconds\r\
    \n\r\nWhat are the best times for these settings yet?\r\n\r\nProblem probably\
    \ cannot be solved for 16x16 but you don't know until you try. What's the best\
    \ solver yet?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nMihai", name: Mihai Stanimir, parent: 0, post_ID: 10,
