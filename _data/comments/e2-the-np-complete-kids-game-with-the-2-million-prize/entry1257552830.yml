    of the 256 pieces are numbered on the back.  I assume these have been ''randomly
    numbered'' which may represent an easy solution to the puzzle namely computers
    don''t do random very well, standard procedure for randomness is to use the clock
    cycle as a ''seed'' I''m not a cryptographer but I would be willing to bet there
    is a pattern in the resulting numbers generated.', name: Anthony Vegas, parent: 0,
