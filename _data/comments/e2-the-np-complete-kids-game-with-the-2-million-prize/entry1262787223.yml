    \ is divided to white and black places like chessboard. \r\nAny of white pieces\
    \ won't touch any of white pieces and\r\nany of black pieces won't touch any of\
    \ black pieces.\r\nThats why each white must have 4 black pair pieces and \r\n\
    yeah black piece must have 4 white pieces...\r\n\r\nThats pretty clear...\r\n\r\
    \nNow in Eternity II each complete pattern is divided into two pieces. In this\
    \ case to white and black piece.\r\nThats why total sum of each pattern must be\
    \ same in black and white pieces... \r\n\r\nNow if somebody could sort these pieces\
    \ really fast to even piles it could be found. \r\n\r\nAnother thing if the piles\
    \ ain't even the puzzle is unsolvable... (i used this in my solver, but not very\
    \ good speedup... maybe with larger board it could help more)", name: P-E-X, parent: 0,
