    \ over and tinkering with are hacks that crawl my sites and helps generate html\
    \ content. For example, a hack that pull out my titles and urls of my images in\
    \ flickr, deviantart.com or redbubble.com and genrate the html to be used on my\
    \ personal site. A photographer mate of mine has created a few ruby hacks that\
    \ do some interesting things along these lines (http://www.davep.org/misc/). Keep\
    \ up the good work. I look forward to seeing this feature in the future.\r\n\r\
    \ncheers\r\ndale", name: dale, parent: 0, post_ID: 14, subscribe: Y, url: 'http://www.littleredplanet.com'}
