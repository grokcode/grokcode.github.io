**When:** 2012-2014

**Contribution:** Solo Founder, Architect, Full Stack Engineer, System Administrator

**Description:** Author Alcove is a book discovery service. "Even if your best friend was a book critic he couldn't give you recommendations this good."

Book and author data is pulled in via an API. The site uses a variation of the item-item algorithm which was shown to have the best performance on this dataset. A few of the smaller details that make the web application shine are a full site search powered by Solr, infinite scroll, a streamlined account creation process, and a delightfully simple UI.

Stats tracking, conversion analysis, and lifecycle emails have been built into the project from the outset.

**More info:** An IPython notebook with [website traffic analysis and notes on scaling and capacity planning](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/grokcode/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/nginx-log-analysis.ipynb) is available. Visit the live site at [authoralcove.com](http://authoralcove.com).

**Contribution:** Full Stack Engineer, Statistical Analysis

**Description:** Statistically analyzes the relative effectiveness of 2 or more versions of a web page.

This SaaS application uses a multi-tiered user system so that partners can change the branding and color scheme of the interface and manage tests for their clients. New tests are created by adding the URLs of the test pages to the application and installing tracking codes on the client&#8217;s server. The test results can then be viewed on the web application&#8217;s reports page.

</div>

**When:** 2004

**Contribution:** Solo Developer

**Description:** The joke generator is programmatically seeded with knowledge about different nouns and modifiers, then uses that vocabulary to make jokes. The generator searches every possible combination of <modifier> <noun>, <modifier> <noun> in its vocabulary, and tries to create a punchline based on different transformations. All of the jokes are of the form: “What do you get when you cross X with Y?” This code was written as a final project for a graduate level AI class at UC Berkeley.

_Q:_ What do you get when you cross a port with Frosted Flakes? _A:_ I don&#8217;t know but it&#8217;s serial!

_More info:_ The code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/grokcode/Joke-Generator).
