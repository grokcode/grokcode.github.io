</div>

**When:** 2012-2014

**Contribution:** Solo Founder, Architect, Full Stack Engineer, System Administrator

**Description:** Author Alcove is a book discovery service. "Even if your best friend was a book critic he couldn't give you recommendations this good."

Book and author data is pulled in via an API. The site uses a variation of the item-item algorithm which was shown to have the best performance on this dataset. A few of the smaller details that make the web application shine are a full site search powered by Solr, infinite scroll, a streamlined account creation process, and a delightfully simple UI.

Stats tracking, conversion analysis, and lifecycle emails have been built into the project from the outset.

**More info:** An IPython notebook with [website traffic analysis and notes on scaling and capacity planning](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/grokcode/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/nginx-log-analysis.ipynb) is available. Visit the live site at [authoralcove.com](http://authoralcove.com).

**Contribution:** Writer, Theme Porter

**Description:** GrokCode has been alive in one form or another since 2007. It was previously the home of the GrokCode Development Shop and blog, but now that I have moved away from consulting, it serves as an archive of articles on software development. It is a space for publishing tutorials, long form articles, and opinion pieces covering the various facets of building things on the internet. 

GrokCode is a Jekyll static site running on GitHub pages, with comments provided by Staticman.

**More info:** You're already here, but you can look at the [GrokCode homepage](http://grokcode.com) or find out more [about me](http://grokcode.com/about).

## Odds & Ends {#odds-n-ends}

**Django Template Field:** An open source Django app for storing templates in the database and rendering them via a database manager. Check out the [docs](https://django-template-field.readthedocs.io/), download from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-template-field/), or [browse the source code](https://github.com/orcasgit/django-template-field).

**Django Email Analytics:** An open source Django app that seamlessly adds Google Analytics tracking codes to emails sent with Django. It provides a wrapper for Django&#8217;s standard email backends. Download the app from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-email-analytics) or [browse the source](https://github.com/grokcode/django-email-analytics) on Github.

**Joke generator:** The joke generator is programmatically seeded with knowledge about different nouns and modifiers, then uses that vocabulary to make jokes. All of the jokes are of the form: “What do you get when you cross X with Y?” This code was written as a final project for a graduate level AI class at UC Berkeley. _Q:_ What do you get when you cross a port with Frosted Flakes? _A:_ I don't know but it's serial!
